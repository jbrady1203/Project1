Daily Progress,"UN chief urges G20 leaders to send strong message on climate change: ‘We have no time to lose’ NEW DELHI — U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres on Friday urged the Group of 20 top economic powers, which are responsible for more than 80% of the emissions that cause global warming, to use their weekend summit to send a strong message on climate change. Guterres said all licensing or funding for new fossil fuel projects should be stopped and that the G20 must keep the 2.7 degree goal alive, referring to the 2015 Paris climate agreement that set the global guardrail in atmospheric warming, with countries pledging to try to prevent that much long-term warming if possible. Earlier this year, the U.N. weather agency had said that there’s a two-out-of-three chance that the world will temporarily hit a key warming limit within the next five years. Climate ministers of the G20 nations ended their last meeting of the year in July without resolving major disagreements on climate policies. “The climate crisis is worsening dramatically — but the collective response is lacking in ambition, credibility and urgency,” Guterres said at a news conference at the U.N. office in New Delhi. India's priorities for the G20 summit include efforts to develop alternative fuels like hydrogen, resource efficiency and reforming development banks like the World Bank and International Monetary Fund to help make funds more accessible for lower- and middle-income countries as they seek solutions to combat climate change. Guterres called on big emitters to make additional efforts to cut emissions and rich countries to meet the climate finance commitments made already. “If we are indeed one global family,” the U.N. chief said, referring to India’s theme for the meetings, “we today resemble a rather dysfunctional one.” As leaders gathered for the weekend summit, Russia's war on Ukraine threatened to dominate the talks, with its effect on food and energy security along with other global implications. Guterres said with the problems facing the world, now was the time for countries to work together, saying “we have no time to lose.” “Divisions are growing, tensions are flaring up, and trust is eroding — which together raise the specter of fragmentation, and ultimately, confrontation,” he said. “This fracturing would be deeply concerning in the best of times, but in our times, it spells catastrophe.” On Friday, the United Nations also released a technical report that assesses where various countries stand in their efforts to reduce carbon emissions. The report said that global emissions aren't in line with climate goals and that “there is a rapidly narrowing window to raise ambition and implement existing commitments in order to limit warming to 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit above preindustrial levels.” Guterres asked nations that are part of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development to aim to reach net zero emissions of greenhouse gases by 2040 and for emerging economies to reach the same goal by 2050. “Phasing fossil fuels out is going to be a crucial, messy, and unavoidable fight. But it’s one that leaders need to have. And have it now,” said Madhura Joshi, energy analyst at the climate think tank E3G. Joshi who has been closely following the climate policy discussions at the G20 gatherings added, “In the midst of raging climate impacts, the world needs G20 leaders to move beyond their differences and agree to an ambitious and equitable agenda of action this decade.”",Liberal
New York Times,"Biden Administration to Bar Drilling on Millions of Acres in Alaska:The administration will cancel oil and gas leases in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and set aside more than half of the National Petroleum Reserve. In its most aggressive move yet to protect federal land from oil and gas exploration, the Biden administration announced on Wednesday that it would prohibit drilling in 13 million acres of pristine wilderness in the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska and cancel all drilling leases in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. The new regulations would ensure what the administration called “maximum protections” for nearly half of the petroleum reserve but would not stop the enormous $8 billion Willow oil drilling project in the same vicinity, which President Biden approved this year. Climate activists, particularly young environmentalists, were angered by Mr. Biden’s decision in March to allow the Willow project, calling it a “carbon bomb.” Many called the move a betrayal of Mr. Biden’s campaign promise of “no new drilling, period” on federal lands and waters. Since then, the administration has taken pains to emphasize its efforts to reduce the carbon emissions that result from burning oil and gas and that are driving climate change.“We have a responsibility to protect this treasured region for all ages,” Mr. Biden said in a statement. “Canceling all remaining oil and gas leases issued under the previous administration in the Arctic Refuge and protecting more than 13 million acres in the western Arctic will help preserve our Arctic lands and wildlife, while honoring the culture, history, and enduring wisdom of Alaska Natives who have lived on these lands since time immemorial.” The Biden administration had promised some new protections in the Arctic when it approved the Willow project. The policies announced on Wednesday, however, go significantly farther by canceling the refuge leases and explicitly prohibiting new oil and gas leasing in 10.6 million acres of the petroleum reserve. An additional 2.4 million acres would be subject to strict safeguards, requiring the Bureau of Land Management to show that any development would result in minimal effects on wildlife. “Biden was surprised by how angry environmental nonprofits were over Willow” and is trying to return to their “good graces,” said Douglas Brinkley, a presidential historian at Rice University. Deirdre Shelly, campaigns director for the Sunrise Movement, said young people remained angry about the Willow decision and that the new Arctic protections did not make up for it. But she did praise the new announcements as “exactly the sort of thing young people and people in the climate movement want to see from the president.” Yet the decision carries some political risk, because oil prices are on the rise and Republicans are accusing Mr. Biden of harming the country’s energy independence, despite the fact that United States oil production is poised to break records this year. The move also could face opposition from some Alaska Native groups that argue that communities depend on drilling for jobs and revenue to support schools and other public services. And it is likely to face a legal challenge from the fossil fuel industry. “Today’s announcement sets a concerning precedent for the future of oil and natural gas leasing on federal lands, said Holly Hopkins, a vice president at the American Petroleum Institute, which represents oil and gas companies. She accused the Biden administration of sending “mixed signals” about drilling in the United States. The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge was opened to drilling under President Donald J. Trump, a move that outraged environmentalists and overturned six decades of protections for the area, the largest remaining stretch of untouched wilderness in the United States. The refuge in the northeastern corner of Alaska is home to grizzly and polar bears, snowy owls, migratory birds and herds of moose and caribou. But it also sits atop an estimated 11 billion barrels of oil and, for years, the fossil fuel industry, members of the Alaskan congressional delegation and state leaders have lobbied for drilling. In 2017 Congress passed, and Mr. Trump signed, a tax law that not only authorized but required leasing for drilling in the wildlife refuge. The Trump administration held a lease sale that attracted just three bidders, including the Alaska Industrial Development and Export Authority, a state agency. Most of the major oil companies stayed on the sidelines. On his first day in office, Mr. Biden signed an executive order halting Arctic drilling and in 2021 suspended the leases that had been granted by the Trump administration, citing problems with environmental reviews. Last month a federal judge rejected a challenge by the state of Alaska, saying the federal government had the authority to suspend the leases while it conducted an additional environmental analysis. That review found “multiple legal deficiencies” in the analysis that had been conducted by the Trump administration. Interior Secretary Deb Haaland said two of the leases in the refuge had been canceled and refunded at the request of the leaseholders. The remaining leases held by the Alaska development authority covered about 365,000 acres in the coastal plain and were rescinded Wednesday. “There are some places where oil and gas drilling and industrial development simply do not belong,” Ms. Haaland said. “With today’s action, no one will have rights to drill for oil in one of the most sensitive landscapes on earth. Climate change is the crisis of our lifetime, and we cannot ignore the disproportionate impacts being felt in the Arctic.” Average temperatures in the Arctic are increasing about four times as fast as the rest of the globe. The area is often described as “ground zero” for climate change because of record-breaking heat, thawing permafrost and glacier melt. “We know that our sacred land is only temporarily safe from oil and gas development,” said Bernadette Demientieff, the executive director of the Gwich’in Steering Committee, an Alaska Native group opposed to drilling. “We urge the administration and our leaders in Congress to repeal the oil and gas program and permanently protect the Arctic Refuge.” The Alaska development corporation denounced the Biden administration for canceling its leases and said it would take the Interior Department to court. “This time, we will ask the court to allow us to conduct discovery that could include taking the deposition of Biden’s messenger, Secretary Haaland, and possibly other administration officials involved so the real motives are made public,” the agency said in a statement. John Leshy, a public lands expert who served in the Interior Department during the Carter and Clinton administrations, noted that the state had been the only remaining leaseholder in the refuge. The Biden administration could have standing to cancel those leases, he said, if it found that environmental reviews and other compliance measures on the leases had been inadequate. Mr. Leshy said the outcome of a legal fight between Alaska and the Biden administration was not predictable. “The bigger picture here is that no one but the state sees any future in drilling the refuge,” he said.",Liberal
New York Times,"At Africa’s First Climate Summit, a Clear Call to the World: Invest in Us. The inaugural summit in Kenya’s capital, attended by tens of thousands, was imbued with frustration at Western financial institutions. Heads of state from across Africa concluded an inaugural climate summit on Wednesday in Nairobi, Kenya’s capital, by issuing a declaration that called for an urgent restructuring of the way wealthier nations engage with the continent. The declaration stressed numerous times that rather than being a hapless victim, Africa was primed for leadership on clean energy and environmental stewardship. But to make that happen, the statement said, the world’s industrialized countries, which are largely responsible for the pollution that is causing climate change, must first unlock access to their wealth through investments, instead of relegating their contributions to aid when disasters strike. This lack of financing is one of the biggest issues dividing rich and poor nations as the world struggles to slash carbon dioxide emissions. It will be one of the main points of contention at the United Nations global climate summit starting Nov. 30 in Dubai. The historic gathering in Nairobi was partly an effort by poorer nations to amplify their argument. At the event, investors announced what amounted to around $23 billion that would go toward projects including solar microgrids, carbon markets and reforestation. But it was unclear how much of that money represented commitments, as opposed to intentions. Kenya’s president, William Ruto, who acted as the summit’s host and master of ceremonies, said that Africa had 60 percent of the world’s renewable energy potential and nearly a third of the minerals crucial to electrifying industries that are currently dependent on planet-warming fossil fuels. Meanwhile, 600 million people in Africa have little or no access to electricity. “We must go green fast, before industrializing, and not vice versa,” Mr. Ruto said.Multinational lending institutions have long considered many African countries too risky for investments in infrastructure like renewable energy because of concerns about economic mismanagement and heavy debt loads, coupled with issues like corruption and conflict.The document, called the Nairobi Declaration, said it would serve as “a basis for Africa’s common position” ahead of the United Nations-sponsored climate talks in Dubai later this year. The summit drew tens of thousands of delegates from around the world to East Africa’s commercial hub. Its events, which took place in the Kenyatta International Convention Center, downtown Nairobi’s most iconic building, an Afro-modernist skyscraper built in the 1970s, had the feel of a trade fair, except that the main audience was banks, private equity firms, philanthropies and donor governments. Those potential investors, and particularly Western ones, were being asked to put their money where their mouth is. Despite pledges in the past to infuse more than $100 billion in climate-related financing to the world’s least developed countries, the wealthy world has fallen far short of those targets while plowing trillions of dollars into renewable energy in their own countries. ""An injustice burns at the heart of the climate crisis, and its flame is scorching hopes and possibilities here in Africa,” said António Guterres, the U.N. Secretary General, who was one of many international dignitaries in attendance. The tension underlying the summit was clear in speech after speech in which African leaders lamented the lack of urgency in fulfilling financing pledges.The United Arab Emirates, one of the world’s main oil producers and host of the annual U.N. climate conference this year, made some of the largest commitments, including $4.5 billion toward clean energy and $450 million in carbon credits, though the fine print on the latter indicated it was a “nonbinding letter of intent.” The U.A.E. is seeking to recast itself as a renewable energy superpower. Some African countries have long relied on renewable energy for most of their power generation. In Kenya, Mr. Ruto said, more than 90 percent of electricity is renewable, largely from geothermal sources in the Great Rift Valley. But outside the halls of the convention center, Kenyans were asking tougher questions about whom the conference and its lofty goals really served. “The energy discussion masks our economic crisis,” said Mordecai Ogada, an author and a leading Kenyan voice on environmental issues. “Yes, we get most of our electricity from renewables. But we pay foreign companies to generate that power exorbitantly in foreign currency,” he said. “Manufacturing has become expensive, which drives inflation. As far as the lives of Kenyans are concerned, the source of energy is completely immaterial.”Kenya’s currency has lost around a third of its value against the dollar over the past two years, and Mr. Ruto has raised taxes on gas and on small businesses that have deepened a cost-of-living crisis. More than eight out of 10 Kenyans live on less than five dollars a day, according to the World Bank. The summit’s message of unity was undercut somewhat because the top leaders from some of Africa’s largest economies, including Nigeria, South Africa, Ethiopia and Egypt, didn’t attend. Leaders from countries that recently experienced coups, or that are embroiled in conflicts, like Sudan, Niger and Gabon, were also not present. And despite taking a leading role in past climate discussions, the president of the Democratic Republic of Congo, Félix Tshisekedi, also did not attend. At the heart of the attendees’ request to the world was “concessional” finance — essentially, loans at below-market interest rates and with more lenient timelines for repayment. Huge amounts of concessional finance could in the near future come from the World Bank and International Monetary Fund, among other large lenders, if they follow through on promised reforms to the way they assess risk and incorporate climate considerations in their loan structuring.“As recently as eight months ago, it was still a debate on the World Bank board as to whether climate investments were a trade-off with economic development,” said a senior U.S. Treasury official attending the summit, speaking on condition of anonymity in accordance with Treasury Department protocol. The official said that nearly $50 billion in funding that could go toward concessional finance from the United States via multilateral development banks was pending congressional approval. President Biden has said he wants Congress to earmark more than $11 billion for climate aid, but he managed to get only $1 billion in the last budget. The official and others with experience working in those lending institutions pointed to the recent change of leadership at the World Bank as a likely accelerator of internal reforms geared toward releasing hundreds of billions of dollars in climate-positive investments in the world’s lesser-developed countries. “The reason multilateral development banks were created was to take on these kind of risks, global ones,” said Andrew Steer, who worked for years in the World Bank’s risk department, and now heads the Bezos Earth Fund, a philanthropy founded by Jeff Bezos. Instead, they became ever more cautious about protecting their credit ratings. That trend has finally begun to reverse, Mr. Steer said. “The special sauce is momentum — building a sense that the things banks thought were risky aren’t as much as they thought,” he said. “And as this summit shows, we are gathering speed.” ",Liberal
New York Times,"Climate Report Card Says Countries Are Trying, but Urgently Need Improvement. The global assessment, two years in the making, is the first official gauge of progress under the 2015 Paris Agreement. Eight years after world leaders approved a landmark agreement in Paris to fight climate change, countries have made only limited progress in staving off the most dangerous effects of global warming, according to the first official report card on the global climate treaty. Many of the worst-case climate change scenarios that were much feared in the early 2010s look far less likely today, the report said. The authors partly credit the 2015 Paris Agreement, under which, for the first time, almost every country agreed to submit a voluntary plan to curb its own planet-warming emissions. Since then, the rise in global greenhouse gases has notably slowed. Yet those efforts still aren’t enough to avoid calamity, according to the report, which was written by representatives from the United States and South Africa and based on contributions from hundreds of governments, scientists and civil society groups from around the world. Under the Paris Agreement, countries vowed to limit the rise in average global temperatures to “well below” 2 degrees Celsius, or 3.6 Fahrenheit, above preindustrial levels and make a good-faith effort to stay at 1.5 degrees Celsius. Past that level, the dangers from intense flooding, wildfires, drought, heat waves and species extinction could become unmanageable, scientists have said. Earth has already heated up roughly 1.2 degrees Celsius since preindustrial times. Countries are far from meeting those goals. Current climate pledges would put the world on track for a significantly more hazardous 2.5 degrees Celsius or so of warming by 2100, assuming nations followed through on their plans. In order to keep global warming at safer levels, global emissions would need to plunge roughly 60 percent by 2035, which would most likely require a much faster expansion of energy sources like wind, solar or nuclear power and a sharp decrease in pollution from fossil fuels like oil, coal and natural gas. The window for keeping warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius, the report said, is “rapidly narrowing.” The new report is part of what’s known as the global stocktake. When countries approved the Paris Agreement, they agreed to meet every five years, starting in 2023, to officially assess how the fight against climate change was going and see whether they should ratchet up their efforts.The report, nearly two years in the making, is meant to serve as the foundation for the next round of United Nations climate negotiations, known as COP28, that will start in late November in Dubai, in the United Arab Emirates. There, countries will discuss how to respond to the global stocktake and what more they can do. “I urge governments to carefully study the findings of the report and ultimately understand what it means for them and the ambitious action they must take next,” said Simon Stiell, the United Nations climate head. “The global stocktake is a critical moment for greater ambition and accelerating action.” The report avoids singling out any individual countries for success or failure, underscoring one of the thorniest dynamics in global climate talks. Everyone agrees that the world as a whole should cut emissions faster, but nations sharply disagree over who, exactly, should do more. Developing countries like India say that wealthy emitters like the United States and Europe should curtail their fossil fuel use more rapidly. U.S. officials, in turn, often point out that China needs to do much more now that it has become the world’s largest emitter by far.The man overseeing this year’s negotiations, Sultan al-Jaber, is the head of both the Emirates’ biggest renewable energy company and its national oil company, a dual role that has provoked criticism from many environmentalists, who say he is unlikely to be an impartial mediator.Mr. al-Jaber has said he wants countries to triple renewable energy capacity by 2030. He also wants nations to agree, for the first time, on a long-term goal of phasing out “unabated” fossil fuels. That phrasing would allow for the continued use of oil, coal or gas if companies can capture and bury the emissions those fuels produce — a technology that has struggled to gain traction because of high costs. The new global stocktake report says those measures, and many others, are “urgently” needed. “The United Nations’ polite prose glosses over what is a truly damning report card for global climate efforts,” said Ani Dasgupta, president of the World Resources Institute. “Carbon emissions? Still climbing. Rich countries’ finance commitments? Delinquent. Adaptation support? Lagging woefully behind.”One perennial sticking point in global climate talks is that developing nations say they can’t afford to shift rapidly away from fossil fuels and adapt to fiercer heat waves and storms without outside help. Under the Paris deal, wealthy emitters like the United States and Europe vowed to provide $100 billion per year from public and private sources by 2020 for this purpose. But they have yet to fulfill that promise. In 2020, industrialized countries provided $83.3 billion in climate finance. And only a small fraction of that money goes toward adaptation, such as building sea walls or helping farmers cope with drought, which is often the most pressing need. The report notes that developing countries will ultimately need trillions of dollars to prepare for climate change and calls for wider systemic reforms, such as reforming lending practices at multilateral banks or aiding countries that are saddled with large debt burdens. “There’s been so much focus on holding developed countries accountable for their $100 billion promise, which is absolutely important,” said Charlene Watson, a senior research associate at the Overseas Development Institute. “But the reality is we’ll need so much more.” Countries have made some progress in adapting to climate threats by, for instance, building flood barriers or installing early-warning systems for tropical cyclones. But those efforts are often “incremental” and unequally distributed, the report warned. Preparing for future threats, like dwindling freshwater supplies or irreversible ecosystem damage, will require “transformational” changes in climate adaptation. One obstacle, the report noted, is that many adaptation efforts “are failing to keep pace with increasing climate impacts and risks.” “It’s a lot harder to track progress on adaptation than it is to track progress on finance or cutting emissions,” said Richard Klein of the Stockholm Environment Institute, who added that coming up with measurable global goals for adaptation would be a key challenge for future climate talks. Some experts faulted the report for being too vague in many of its recommendations. “The opportunity was missed to make clear proposals on what countries could concretely implement, how much financial support should be provided and on what it should be spent,” said Niklas Höhne, a German climate scientist and founding partner of NewClimate Institute. “On these issues, the report often remains on the surface.” The big question now is how countries will respond to the global stocktake. “We’ve had lots of reports about lack of progress over the years, but what’s different about this one is that it isn’t a group of scientists or a single U.N. agency saying this,” said Rachel Kyte, a veteran climate diplomat and former dean of the Fletcher School at Tufts University. “This is something that all the countries have had a say in.” “This is like sitting down with your doctor and agreeing that your liver could be better, you really need to be in better shape,” Ms. Kyte added. “Now are you going to get off the couch and do something about it, or just sit there and ignore it?”",Liberal
New York Times,"Clean Energy Projects Are Booming Everywhere. Except in Poor Nations. A big obstacle is the lack of loans, a subject of intense disagreement between richer and poorer countries. But in Congo, a hard-fought solar investment shows a possible path forward. The world is racing ahead with enormous investments in renewable energy, for the first time this year plowing more money into solar power than oil. But the world’s poorest countries, mostly in Africa, are effectively priced out of the action by a global lending system that considers them too risky for investment. Only 2 percent of global investment in renewable energy has been in Africa, where nearly a billion people have little or no access to electricity. It’s a paradox, Africa’s leaders argue. Clean energy projects would help stabilize their countries and economies, they say, reducing the very risk that investors say they fear. It’s an issue that looms large this week at a climate summit in Kenya, as it will at climate talks sponsored by the United Nations later this year in Dubai. It also preoccupies Archip Lobo, whose company, against the odds, raised $70 million in international funds this year — capping half a decade of effort — to build solar-powered microgrids in Congo. “A year ago, we were about halfway to losing hope,” Mr. Lobo said. “We were thinking, These lenders all want us to assure them there’s no political risk, no security risk. How can you do that in Congo?” He has lived that risk. At 8, Mr. Lobo was made a refugee. His brothers were forcibly recruited by the army, and other family members were raped. Yet he also embodies an entrepreneurial spirit that thrives in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Mr. Lobo, now 31, got a degree and co-founded a company that roasts some of the delectable coffee that grows in eastern Congo. While his second company, Nuru — the word means “light” in Swahili — is small by global standards, investments like these are important, experts say, because if the pattern of clean energy investment doesn’t change, by midcentury more than three-quarters of all carbon dioxide emissions could come from the least-developed countries, whose populations and economies are growing faster than anywhere else. Like many businessmen across Africa, Mr. Lobo found himself stymied by the price and paucity of electricity. His coffee company relied on just an hour or two of power from a generator fueled by diesel that had to be trucked thousands of miles from ports in Kenya and Tanzania. He co-founded Nuru to try to solve that problem. It negotiated a partnership with a consortium of philanthropic funds, anchored by the Bezos Earth Fund and the Rockefeller and Ikea foundations, that agreed to put in the majority of the recent funding, which is intended to give Nuru a chance to prove that, rather than being a risky investment, it is an enterprise that can make money and transform the local economy. “We’re trying to use philanthropic money to create proof points to get the market moving and show it’s less risky than international lending institutions and private banks think,” said Simon Harford, the chief executive of the consortium, known as the Global Energy Alliance for People and Planet. With the money, Nuru will increase its urban microgrids in Congo to four, from one, and be able to produce 13 times as much electricity. The company eventually hopes to provide millions of Congolese with cheaper and more reliable electricity than what is produced by the diesel generators that most now use. More than 70 million of Congo’s 100 million people cannot afford or access electricity. Its population is currently growing faster than new electricity customers are being brought online. “I pay three times less to Nuru than what I paid for diesel, so you can imagine what it means for my business,” said Ezekia Rubona, 27, who runs a shop where people can make photocopies, print banners, upload videos and surf the internet. “That generator, too, it always surged. We would lose machines that way.” While the financing is a major breakthrough for Nuru, the company is receiving it at an interest rate of more than 15 percent, five times as high as interest rates for many renewable energy projects in wealthier countries where companies have easier access to credit. Nuru also can’t afford to hire a seasoned chief financial officer. It could barely pay its small team over the years for trying to wrangle an investment that elsewhere in the renewable energy world might seem paltry. The clincher, said Mr. Lobo, was getting investors to actually come to Congo. That was only made harder by an Ebola epidemic in the region and then Covid-19, as well as unrest that is so persistent it rarely makes global headlines. On the day a New York Times reporter arrived in the city of Goma to visit Nuru’s existing microgrid, state security forces killed more than 40 people who were gathering for a protest against the presence of a longstanding U.N. peacekeeping force widely seen as ineffective and a source of corruption. A day later, Goma was back to its usual bustle. “Investors are human beings too,” Mr. Lobo said. “Once you come here and see the hunger for energy, the potential for growth, you can finally look past the risks and see what a transformative investment this will be, a real, genuine business opportunity.” What African leaders gathering in Nairobi, Kenya, this week for the first-ever Africa Climate Summit hope to do is persuade global investors and multinational development banks like the International Monetary Fund that African companies need not only more deals like Nuru’s but also better ones. There’s a term, “concessional,” for certain kinds of international loans that are designed to help less wealthy international borrowers. The idea is that loans might have below-market interest rates or grace periods for repayment. Nuru’s loan is anything but concessional. But the idea is to prime the pump for bigger investments. “The multinational banks are the ones who need to be the mobilizers-in-chief,” said Chavi Meattle, an expert on climate finance in Africa at the Climate Policy Initiative, a nonprofit research group. “They’ve made promises to reform, but they are not following through fast enough.” Ms. Meattle co-wrote a paper last year outlining the flow of climate investments into Africa, which found that a vast majority of what was already a small pool of money went to just a few of Africa’s most advanced economies, like Egypt, Morocco and South Africa. In smaller countries like Sierra Leone, those seeking to develop renewable energy face an even steeper uphill battle than Nuru, which has Congo’s large population and famed natural resources as points of reference for potential investors. Kofie Macauley, a Sierra Leonean engineer, has been trying to raise money for a hydroelectric project in a rural area of the country for a decade. He has courted roughly 60 equity partners, big and small in Europe and the United States, but to no avail. “Our story is not glamorous,” he said. “We’re a small country with a small project, and to make it happen we need the risk appetite to go up.”",Liberal
New York Times,"In a Storied River, Fish Are Dying in Droves as Climate Change Scorches Canada. The salmon were once so plentiful in the river that old-timers talk about having been able to cross on the backs of fish so thick they were like steppingstones. Such was the renown of the Cowichan River, flowing east on Canada’s Vancouver Island, that its fly-fishing conditions were posted in fishing clubs in London. John Wayne and Bing Crosby were regulars in Cowichan Bay. So when hundreds of young salmon and trout were found dead in the river last month, even as record wildfires burned across Canada, the news made the front page of the local newspaper. The die-off, the biggest in living memory, quickly led to an investigation. It remains a mystery. Government officials found partially treated wastewater in the river a couple of weeks after the fish were found, but they have yet to draw conclusions about its impact. Local scientists suspect the bigger culprit is climate change, which has contributed to the decline of salmon populations in British Columbia by increasing droughts and heat waves. In a summer of global catastrophes for Canada, climate change has been felt across this vast country — from Cowichan Valley on the Pacific Coast to Halifax on the Atlantic, from the long border with the United States to the remotest towns above the Arctic Circle. But if the world has been consumed with the fires raging across Canada’s forests, turned into tinderboxes from the effects of climate change, the plight of the river has hit close to home in Cowichan Valley. A biologist, swimming in a wet suit for miles downriver from where the juvenile fish, or fry, had been found, discovered hundreds more dead inside pools at the bottom of the river. Further downstream, past eerily “barren zones” with no fish at all, he found dozens of dead adults inside larger, deeper pools — foot-long rainbow trout and even bigger brown ones. “It was the first time not just in my career, but the first time in my life, that I had seen anything like that,” said the biologist, Tim Kulchyski, 50, who said he “basically grew up in the river” as a member of Cowichan Tribes, where he now works as a natural resources expert. The mass death of the cold-water fish has occurred during another summer of extreme drought and heat on Vancouver Island, a region known for its temperate climate. Wildfires cut off access to some of the island’s western communities for more than two weeks during the tourist season, leading to losses estimated by a local chamber of commerce at around $30 million. The country has experienced a summer of extreme weather events and record-shattering temperatures. Inuit communities, some above the Arctic Circle, have broken records with temperatures above 90 degrees Fahrenheit. With at least a month left in the wildfire season, fires have burned the equivalent of the area of the state of Georgia, about 38 million acres of forests, more than seven times the annual average. The fires have forced nearly 200,000 Canadians to evacuate from their homes this year and led to the deployment of thousands of foreign firefighters to help, as experts have called for a fundamental rethinking of Canada’s forest management and firefighting. In Cowichan (pronounced cow-i-chin) Valley, the effects of the provincewide drought have been most visible in the river that has sustained Indigenous communities for centuries and helped grow local industry and tourism. Recognized as a Canadian Heritage River, the Cowichan’s ecosystem can no longer survive without direct human intervention, experts and local groups say. “There’s a lot of talk about climate change, but living here, it’s undeniable,” said Tom Rutherford, a salmon biologist and executive director of the Cowichan Watershed Board. “We’ve never had a significant fish kill like this in the Cowichan River, or at least in living memory,” Mr. Rutherford said. “The event is still under investigation. But if there was more water in the river, if it wasn’t this hot, the impacts would have been less. Salmon are cold-water species. Things may not have in the past tipped them over the edge. Now they do.” Government investigators found partially treated wastewater from a local treatment facility in the river 14 days after the dead fry were first discovered, but have not reached any conclusions yet about its “toxicity” or “impacts on fish,” according to a spokeswoman for Environment and Climate Change Canada, a federal department. In recent years, the government and other experts have warned that increasing droughts, heat waves and heavy rains exacerbated by climate change are leading to the sharp decline of British Columbia’s salmon population, especially of species that spend more time in rivers. Thousands of salmon have been found dead in rivers and creeks on the province’s Pacific Coast amid severe drought in the past two years. The stresses from a changing habitat also weaken the fish and make them more likely to die from other causes, experts say. From its source at Cowichan Lake, the river flows for 30 miles across southeastern Vancouver Island, in one of the most fertile areas in Canada, past forests once full of towering cedars and Douglas firs, before draining into the Salish Sea. The Cowichan was the perfect habitat for chinook, chum and coho salmon, which could gorge on insects and swim in cool water shaded by trees. The local Indigenous communities, according to their cosmology, are the people who descended from the sky to earth where they found a river full of salmon. But with temperatures on the rise, the river has been in a perennial state of crisis. Scientists predict it will become too warm for salmon to survive without intervention. The Cowichan Tribes, with a population of around 5,000, have for centuries caught salmon in the river using weirs, a traditional fish trap made from logs. The tribes in the past used the river for transportation, in canoes made from the bark of red cedars. They wove baskets from the roots and used the wood for totem poles. In the 20th century, loggers arrived, cutting down many of the trees, and with them, went the shade the river relied on. Hydroelectric power plants built upstream have also impacted the river, its flows and the fish. Over time, more people settled in Cowichan Valley, drawn by its natural beauty and mild climate. Population growth led to more housing and roads, and the hard surfaces increased rainwater runoff into the river. In recent years, the Cowichan Tribes have lobbied for a higher weir to store more water in the lake, an expensive project that is controversial because it would submerge more land. But the tribes argue it is necessary to secure their future and the salmon’s. Last month, Mr. Rutherford of the watershed board and a group of scientists and local experts embarked on a five-day fact-finding mission to study the river, which ended with a ceremony at Cowichan Tribes’ longhouse, where the group offered prayers for the river’s healing. “We need to do everything we can to protect this river, because it’s not just a river, it’s our life,” said Chief William Seymour of the Cowichan Tribes. “If the river dies, we die.”",Liberal
New York Times,"Urban Animals Can’t Take the Heat, Study Finds. A warming climate could make cities even less hospitable to wild mammals, according to new research.Don’t let the rats fool you. Although the pizza-pilfering vagabonds — and a variety of other creatures — thrive in cities, for many wild animals urban environments are unappealing homes, covered in concrete and carved up by car traffic. As buildings go up and roads are laid down, some species seem to vanish from the landscape, and animal communities often become less diverse, scientists have found. But not all cities are created equal. Urbanization appears to take a greater toll on wild mammals in hotter, less vegetated locales than in cooler, greener ones, according to a new study, which was published in Nature Ecology & Evolution on Monday. The findings suggest that climate change could exacerbate the effects of urbanization on wild animals. “As our climate warms, the heat of our cities is something that is going to continue to be a challenge to both us and wildlife,” said Jeffrey Haight, a postdoctoral scholar at Arizona State University and an author of the new study. The researchers analyzed photos snapped by wildlife cameras at 725 sites across 20 North American cities. The cities, which included Chicago, Phoenix, and Tacoma, Wash., were participants in the Urban Wildlife Information Network, an ongoing effort to collect data on urban biodiversity. In each city, the cameras were deployed in an assortment of locations; some camera sites, like those near airports or freeways, were highly urban, while others, like parks and trails, were less developed. The scientists studied the photos taken during the summer. They detected a total of 37 native mammal species, including raccoons, squirrels, rabbits, foxes, cougars and deer.In general, the researchers found, wild mammals were more common and more diverse at less urbanized sites, reinforcing findings from other studies. But wildlife seemed to cope better with urbanization in cities that were cool or lush — homes to plenty of healthy, green plant life — than in those that were warmer or more barren.For instance, as camera sites became more urban, mammal diversity dropped off more sharply in warm Los Angeles than it did in cooler Salt Lake City. And although Sanford, Fla. and Phoenix, Ariz. are both similarly warm, Sanford has much more greenery than Phoenix. Urban areas of Sanford supported more diverse mammal communities than equally urban areas of Phoenix, the scientists found. The researchers cannot yet say what underpins these patterns, but cities are known to trap heat, making them warmer than less developed areas nearby. In cities that are already in warm climates, this urban heat island effect could “just be making it harder and harder to live,” Dr. Haight speculated. In cooler locales, the relative warmth of cities might also be a boon to animals looking for a temperate home.When it comes to vegetation, the greenery itself could provide welcome food and habitat for urban animals. But green cities also tend to be wetter cities, which could mean other resources, like water, are easier to come by, Dr. Haight said. Larger-bodied animals, such as cougars and elk, were also more negatively affected by urbanization than smaller ones, the researchers found. That may be because larger animals require more space to roam. “Although there is plenty of habitat within cities, it’s often pretty broken up,” Dr. Haight said. Humans might also be less tolerant of large animals that wander into cities, he added.Urban mammals are not as well studied as urban plants or birds, and compiling data on 37 species across 20 cities was “a massive feat,” said Christine Rega-Brodsky, an expert on urban ecology at Pittsburg State University in Pittsburg, Kan., who was not involved in the research. “Our world is rapidly urbanizing and experiencing a global extinction crisis, so we urgently need to understand how human actions impact our native wildlife and overall biodiversity,” she said in an email. The study had limitations. Cameras are not equally good at detecting all species, and the scientists only analyzed photos from North American cities in the summer; different patterns might emerge in other places or seasons. But the research highlights the way in which human-driven changes to the environment can have compounding effects, Dr. Rega-Brodsky said. It also points toward potential solutions, suggesting that perhaps hot, barren cities can help safeguard their animal residents by providing greenery, water and places where wildlife can escape the heat. “Every city in the world has particular features that make it ecologically different from the next and require different strategies to conserve its biodiversity,” Dr. Rega-Brodsky said.",Liberal
New York Times,"Warming Could Push India Toward a Groundwater Crisis. The warming climate could drive India to use up its groundwater much more rapidly in the coming decades, according to projections published Friday in the journal Science Advances. India already pumps up more underground water than any other country, largely to irrigate staple crops like wheat, rice and maize. But hotter temperatures are drying out fields and leaving less moisture to soak into the soil and replenish the aquifers below. Unless big steps are taken to promote water efficiency, underground supplies could shrink between 2041 and 2080 at three times the present rate, the new estimates suggest. Groundwater is vital for farming in India, supplying 60 percent of all irrigation. But growers in parts of the country are already starting to exhaust aquifers — layers of water-soaked dirt and rock — that could take centuries to refill. And, at the moment, India doesn’t have the dams and other infrastructure needed to significantly increase its river-fed irrigation. “If you run out of groundwater, there aren’t other quick fixes, like providing canal irrigation, that can get you to the same level of production,” said Meha Jain, an assistant professor at the University of Michigan’s School for Environment and Sustainability, who contributed to the new research. The researchers first looked at the relationship between groundwater levels, climate and crop water stress in India between 2004 and 2013. They then estimated how groundwater use might respond to three major effects of global warming: greater evaporation, increased rainfall during the summer monsoon season and decreased rain in winter. The researchers found that the additional summertime rain could help refill aquifers, though not by enough to offset increased evaporation from warmer temperatures and increased irrigation needs during the drier winters. “When the temperature is warming, this recharge is actually decreasing in monsoon season,” said Nishan Bhattarai, an assistant professor of geography and environmental sustainability at the University of Oklahoma, who led the new research. So far, India’s groundwater overuse has been most severe in the northwestern breadbasket states of Punjab and Haryana. But the researchers’ modeling suggests that problems could arise by 2050 in the country’s southwest, where aquifers of hard rock can’t hold as much water as those in other areas. In their projections, the authors didn’t try to predict the effects of water-saving changes that haven’t yet occurred on a large scale in India. These include shifts to less thirsty crops like millet, use of more efficient watering techniques like drip irrigation and results from changes in government policy, such as free or cheap electricity in rural areas, which have increased groundwater extraction by enabling poor farmers to run electric pumps. They also didn’t try to account for the possible physical limits to water pumping — in other words, the very real likelihood that wells in parts of India will go completely dry. Many growers in India work on small plots, not industrial farms, so it can be hard to determine how many of them are adopting more environmentally sustainable methods. Dr. Jain is involved in research projects that use satellite-mounted sensors to map agricultural practices at the level of individual fields. “We’re in the golden age of satellite data,” she said. “That’s allowing us to answer these questions at scales that just historically have not been possible.”",Liberal
New York Times,"A First Look From NASA’s New Air Pollution Satellite A new mission will provide hourly updates of air quality in the United States. When scientists switched on the instrument aboard a new satellite this summer, they got a preview of what will soon be the nation’s first continuous record of air pollution. The satellite will stay parked above North America and provide scientists with hourly daytime updates on air pollution nationwide. On Thursday, researchers released their first images, which show changes in nitrogen dioxide pollution over the United States over the course of a day. “It’s really exciting to see the instrument just working as expected,” said Xiong Liu, the deputy mission director and a physicist at the Center for Astrophysics run by Harvard University and the Smithsonian Institution. The satellite instrument, called TEMPO, will be able to measure several other pollutants as well. The images come during a summer of exceptionally bad air quality for the United States, with smoke from wildfires blanketing multiple cities and regions. But even before this summer, over the past decade or so, the gains in air quality Americans have enjoyed since the passage of the Clean Air Act in 1970 had started to plateau. While air pollution has improved over the years, “one-third of Americans are still living in unhealthy levels of air pollution,” Dr. Liu said. Nitrogen dioxide comes from burning fuel and creates other types of pollution through chemical reactions in the air. The images show clear hot spots of the gas around major cities, with higher levels during the morning and evening when there’s more traffic. In addition to peering down on Earth via the new satellite, scientists fanned out across the country on foot and in research planes this July and August, in a tightly choreographed production to try to understand why air quality was no longer improving. Because pollutants can quickly travel thousands of miles on the wind, it’s been hard for scientists to pinpoint the biggest sources of pollution on a national scale. TEMPO’s hourly updates are expected to be a “real game changer” in giving researchers the ability to track air pollution from its source, said Brian McDonald, an environmental engineer with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration who is coordinating this summer’s field research with the satellite. Car traffic has historically been one of the biggest contributors to air pollution, but tighter emissions standards for motor vehicles have reduced pollution from driving. At the same time, the relative importance of consumer products and materials, like paint and pesticides, that emit pollutants known as volatile organic compounds has gone up, Dr. McDonald explained. These compounds react with nitrogen dioxide in the air to create harmful ground-level ozone, which has remained stubbornly high in some places, especially in California and in major metropolitan areas across the country. While the ozone layer high in the atmosphere protects us from cancer-causing ultraviolet radiation, ozone near the ground can aggravate or cause respiratory diseases like asthma, bronchitis and emphysema. Another persistent problem is fine particulate pollution, made of microscopic particles small enough to enter the bloodstream and cause heart and lung disease, strokes and even premature death in severe cases. This pollution, also known as PM2.5, started increasing again around 2016 after years of decline. Wildfires, which are becoming more frequent and more intense as climate change creates hotter and drier conditions, appear to be the main culprit behind this reversal, according to a study published last fall. That research relied on an older satellite that provides daily measurements, said Marshall Burke, a professor of environmental policy at Stanford University and one of the authors of the study. Currently, he and his colleagues rely heavily on computer models of how pollutants move with the wind to fill in the blanks between actual observations. Dr. Burke, who is not involved in the TEMPO mission, is looking forward to having hourly data from the satellite, which will be “closer to a video,” he said. “As you have more and more images, it’s much easier to fill in the map of where things came from,” he added. TEMPO will be able to track air pollution down to a resolution of about four square miles. That’s where this summer’s coordinated flights, drives and walks come in. “The data from these field campaigns acts like a decoder ring” for the satellite instrument, said Tracey Holloway, a professor of energy analysis and policy at the University of Wisconsin-Madison who studies air quality but is not involved in this project. One of the places scientists are gathering data at a granular local level is New York City. Even cities that routinely monitor their air don’t typically have enough equipment to cover all neighborhoods. That’s a problem because within individual cities or regions, air pollution tends to be unevenly distributed. Since late July, a dozen researchers working with NOAA, led by Audrey Gaudel of the University of Colorado Boulder and Prathap Ramamurthy of the City College of New York, have taken turns walking in pairs around the city, carrying a backpack full of buzzing air quality sensors. Onlookers frequently asked if the scientists were going fishing, because of the long, skinny tubes that stick out of the pack to suck in air samples. Each day, one colleague tracked the flight paths of NASA’s research aircraft and gave updates on WhatsApp so the trekkers could walk underneath the planes. The data sets would be compared later. The researchers have covered a dozen routes, making sure to include economically disadvantaged neighborhoods and neighborhoods with more residents of color. These areas often face disproportionate air pollution, but have sparse data. “We’re hoping to have better models and better prediction on the street level,” said Yoshira Ornelas Van Horne, a professor of environmental health at Columbia University and another TEMPO collaborator. It will take a few months to analyze all the data, but the walks themselves have already highlighted the connection between climate change and air quality. (Dr. Ramamurthy said some of the hours long walks at the height of summer were “horrible.”) Higher temperatures are generally associated with higher levels of ozone pollution, and on the hottest sampling day, ozone readings rose above the national standards set by the Environmental Protection Agency, Dr. Gaudel noted. Data from the TEMPO satellite should be available to the general public in spring 2024. In the meantime, more than 400 users, including many state and federal agencies, have signed up as “early adopters.” Researchers at the Mount Sinai Health System in New York plan to use TEMPO data to study how air pollutants affect children’s asthma symptoms. The Connecticut Bureau of Air Management plans to use the data to investigate where the state’s unusually high ozone pollution comes from. Dr. Ornelas Van Horne hopes this summer’s research will arm policymakers with the information needed to do something about the nation’s lingering air quality problems. “We’re all in agreement that air pollution is bad,” she said.",Liberal
New York Times,"Central U.S. Swelters Under Heat Dome, Forcing Cancellations and Precautions A summer of extreme weather continued as residents coped with oppressive heat across a large stretch of the nation’s midsection. An aerial view of children and adults playing in a pool. The heat affecting hundreds of miles of the United States, from Mississippi to Missouri to Minnesota, stands out for its combination of high temperatures and suffocating humidity. By Mitch Smith, Lauryn Higgins and Ann Hinga Klein. Mitch Smith reported from Chicago, Lauryn Higgins from Lincoln, Neb., and Ann Hinga Klein from Adel, Iowa. Aug. 22, 2023. A sprawling blanket of hot and humid air smothering the nation’s midsection this week has challenged temperature records, forced schools to cancel classes and left residents sweating from the Northwoods to the Gulf Coast. Even in a season filled with other climate shocks, this blast of late-summer heat in the central United States stands out for its breadth and its combination of high temperatures and suffocating humidity — in areas including some that are more associated with frigid winters than unbearable summers. Across hundreds of miles, from Mississippi to Missouri to Minnesota, cooling centers have opened, schools without air-conditioning have dismissed early or closed outright, and residents have tried to limit time outdoors. In Omaha, a 1-year-old girl died on Monday after she had been left in a day care center’s van, according to the local police. Temperatures in the area had reached 98 degrees that afternoon. The driver of the van was arrested on Monday on charges of child abuse by neglect resulting in death. “I’ve never seen humidity like this,” said Eric L. Harris, who lives in Lincoln, Neb., where temperatures surpassed 100 degrees on Tuesday and were expected to do so again on Wednesday and Thursday. Mr. Harris, who has been collecting signatures for a proposed ballot question on paid sick leave, said the weather made that work especially difficult. “My biggest fear isn’t trying to get people with opposing views to listen to me,” he said. “It’s that without measures to protect me, I would likely get heat stroke just from standing out in this heat.” Across the continent, this summer has already been defined by weather extremes: deadly wildfires in Hawaii, blankets of smoke from Canadian wildfires, floods caused by a rare tropical storm in California, weeks of stifling heat in Arizona. Though linking individual events to climate change often takes time, researchers have warned that dangerous weather events will become more common as the planet warms. For many Midwestern states, the high temperatures this week have brought added misery in a summer already made difficult by drought. In a cruel meteorological turn, that drought has exacerbated the heat. “The ground is already really dry — it doesn’t take much for the heat to kind of just build up over there,” said Paul Pastelok, a senior meteorologist at AccuWeather. “And that’s what makes it a bigger heat dome that we’re seeing right now.” In the Minneapolis area, better known for its foreboding winter conditions, forecasters said daily temperature records could fall on both Tuesday and Wednesday, with readings of 99 or 100 degrees possible. Tyler Hasenstein, a National Weather Service meteorologist in Minnesota, said a heat dome of this scale might settle over the state every five years or so, “but those typically happen in June, July — and not August, which is kind of the weird thing in this case.” The temperatures were also not expected to drop much after sunset, he said. Meteorologists said high temperatures were forecast to reach up to 20 degrees above average throughout Iowa and neighboring states over the next few days. The humidity will make it feel even more oppressive, with heat indexes that could approach 120 degrees. Forecasters have issued heat alerts, ranging from advisories to excessive heat warnings, for roughly 100 million people across 22 states. In Adel, Iowa, where it was cloudless and in the 90s by midday on Tuesday, the high temperatures meant Amy Heinz was not able to let the dogs play outside at the animal rescue center she runs. “Some of them are going crazy in their kennels,” Ms. Heinz said, but the alternative was simply not safe. Even in a place like Iowa, immune from hurricanes and coastal disasters, Ms. Heinz said extreme conditions were a growing concern. “Every year the weather seems to get worse and worse,” she said. “Between the flooding and the heat, and then we have the extreme cold that we deal with in the winter, it seems it’s worse than it used to be.” With more of the country expected to suffer from extreme heat in the days ahead, contingency plans were already being put in place.Kevin Russell, the superintendent of Downers Grove Grade School District 58 in suburban Chicago, said he started keeping an eye on the forecast late last week. Most buildings in his district are not fully air-conditioned, meaning the 100-degree temperatures that forecasters have discussed are untenable. “We do have limited air-conditioned spaces, so what we’ll do on those hotter days — in the high 80s or even the low 90s — we will rotate students and staff through cooling stations,” Dr. Russell said. “However, when you start talking about 100-plus, you really need to be in that cooling station all the time.” The first day of class in Downers Grove had been set for Wednesday, but Dr. Russell made the difficult choice to push that back to Friday, when cooler weather is expected. “We have thousands of kids in Downers Grove with their backpacks all ready to go and super excited to start the school year,” Dr. Russell said. “Having to delay that, no one takes any joy in that.” But there is good news ahead. Plans are in place to install air-conditioning at all of the district’s schools.",Liberal
New York Times,"His Recycling Symbol Is Everywhere. The E.P.A. Says It Shouldn’t Be. The agency wants to stop using the “chasing arrows” logo on plastics that can’t be recycled. The man who designed it more than 50 years ago agrees that the symbol has been misused. Gary Anderson was a 23-year-old architecture student at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles in 1970 when he entered a design contest sponsored by a box manufacturer for a logo to promote the recycling of paper. He won, spawning a symbol that became international shorthand for repurposing waste materials. His design: three folded-over arrow strips, chasing each other in an endless triangle. It wasn’t until the end of the decade that Mr. Anderson, now 75, saw his creation “take on a life of its own,” beyond his $2,500 prize earnings. Since then, manufacturers have put the logo on all types of products, not just paper items. “The symbol and I had different lives for a time,” said Mr. Anderson, but he came to nurture a “pride of authorship.” Now the environmental agency that oversees recycling efforts in the US is saying the “chasing arrows” logo should be retired from plastics that are difficult to recycle. The Environmental Protection Agency asked the Federal Trade Commission to substitute the arrows logo on plastics with solid triangles, a decision that could clear up confusion. Consumers have long treated the chasing-arrows logo as an indication that an item can be recycled. But when it comes to plastics, that can be “deceptive and misleading,” wrote Jennie Romer from the Environmental Protection Agency. “Not all resin codes can be recycled currently in the US,” she added. Many plastics, especially those numbered from 3 to 7, “are not financially viable to recycle.” Mr. Anderson agreed that the symbol he created was not meant to be used that way but hoped the logo could retain its status for other purposes. “I do see their point,” Mr. Anderson said. “It was meant to be an overarching symbol to say, ‘Hey, this is recycled, this has been recycled, or it’s something you can recycle.’ That’s what it was supposed to be.” More than a thousand environmental groups and individuals have commented that the misuse of the recycling logo in plastic products may be contributing to a growing plastic-waste crisis. Roughly 5 to 6 percent of plastic in the US was recycled in 2021, a drop from 9.5 percent in 2014. Most types of plastic packaging were “economically impossible to recycle,” partly because of the costs associated with collecting and sorting them. The F.T.C. said in December that it was seeking public comment on changes to its environmental advertising and labeling regulations. The problem of handling plastic waste has intensified since. Without effective plastic recycling, the labels have done more harm than good, said John Hocevar, oceans campaign director at Greenpeace U.S.A. The waste overwhelms recycling centers, diverting effort away from items that are easier to recycle. The labels also contribute to a myth that recycling is a solution to the alarming rise of plastic waste. The Environmental Protection Agency is not asking to ditch Mr. Anderson’s logo entirely but believes that companies using the symbol should have to “meet a very high bar.” For a product to qualify as recyclable, the Federal Trade Commission requires that at least 60 percent of the company’s customers have access to recycling facilities where it can be processed. The E.P.A. has asked the F.T.C. to raise that threshold “much higher.” While Mr. Anderson shares the concerns, he is skeptical about efforts to create alternatives to his logo, which arose from a mix of his interests. “Good graphics are beautifully simple, and they also work,” he said. “They convey the concepts that need to be conveyed without having to be explained.”",Liberal
New York Times,"A Republican 2024 Climate Strategy: More Drilling, Less Clean Energy Project 2025, a conservative “battle plan” for the next Republican president, would stop attempts to cut the pollution that is heating the planet and encourage more emissions. During a summer of scorching heat that has broken records and forced Americans to confront the reality of climate change, conservatives are laying the groundwork for a future Republican administration that would dismantle efforts to slow global warming. The move is part of a sweeping strategy dubbed Project 2025 that Paul Dans of the Heritage Foundation, the conservative think tank organizing the effort, has called a “battle plan” for the first 180 days of a future Republican presidency. The climate and energy provisions would be among the most severe swings away from current federal policies. The plan calls for shredding regulations to curb greenhouse gas pollution from cars, oil and gas wells and power plants, dismantling almost every clean energy program in the federal government and boosting the production of fossil fuels — the burning of which is the chief cause of planetary warming. The New York Times asked the leading Republican presidential candidates whether they support the Project 2025 strategy but none of the campaigns responded. Still, several of the architects are veterans of the Trump administration, and their recommendations match positions held by former President Donald J. Trump, the current front-runner for the 2024 Republican nomination. The $22 million project also includes personnel lists and a transition strategy in the event a Republican wins the 2024 election. The nearly 1,000-page plan, which would reshape the executive branch to place more power into the president’s hands, outlines changes for nearly every agency across the government. The Heritage Foundation worked on the plan with dozens of conservative groups ranging from the Heartland Institute, which has denied climate science, to the Competitive Enterprise Institute, which says “climate change does not endanger the survival of civilization or the habitability of the planet.” Mr. Dans said the Heritage Foundation delivered the blueprint to every Republican presidential hopeful. While polls have found that young Republicans are worried about global warming, Mr. Dans said the feedback he has received confirms the blueprint reflects where the majority of party leaders stand. “We have gotten very good reception from this,” he said. “This is a plotting of points of where the conservative movement sits at this time.” There is a pronounced partisan split in the country when it comes to climate change, surveys have shown. An NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll conducted last month found that while 56 percent of respondents called climate change a major threat — including a majority of independents and nearly 90 percent of Democrats — about 70 percent of Republicans said global warming was either a minor threat or no threat at all. Project 2025 does not offer any proposals for curbing the greenhouse gas emissions that are dangerously heating the planet and which scientists have said must be sharply and quickly reduced to avoid the most catastrophic impacts. Asked what the country should do to combat climate change, Diana Furchtgott-Roth, director of the Heritage Foundation’s energy and climate center, said “I really hadn’t thought about it in those terms” and then offered that Americans should use more natural gas. Natural gas produces half the carbon dioxide emissions of coal when burned. But gas facilities frequently leak methane, a greenhouse gas that is much more powerful than carbon dioxide in the short term and has emerged as a growing concern among climate scientists. The blueprint said the next Republican president would help repeal the Inflation Reduction Act, the 2022 law that is offering $370 billion for wind, solar, nuclear, green hydrogen and electric vehicle technology, with most of the new investments taking place in Republican-led states. The plan calls for shuttering a Department of Energy office that has $400 billion in loan authority to help emerging green technologies. It would make it more difficult for solar, wind and other renewable power — the fastest growing energy source in the United States — to be added to the grid. Climate change would no longer be considered an issue worthy of discussion on the National Security Council, and allied nations would be encouraged to buy and use more fossil fuels rather than renewable energy.The blueprint throws open the door to drilling inside the pristine Arctic wilderness, promises legal protections for energy companies that kill birds while extracting oil and gas and declares the federal government has an “obligation to develop vast oil and gas and coal resources” on America’s public lands. Notably, it also would restart a quest for something climate denialists have long considered their holy grail: reversal of a 2009 scientific finding at the Environmental Protection Agency that says carbon dioxide emissions are a danger to public health. Erasing that finding, conservatives have long believed, would essentially strip the federal government of the right to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from most sources. In interviews, Mr. Dans and three of the top authors of the report agreed that the climate is changing. But they insisted that scientists are debating the extent to which human activity is responsible. On the contrary, the overwhelming majority of climate scientists around the world agree that the burning of oil, gas and coal since the Industrial Age has led to an increase of the average global temperature of 1.2 degrees Celsius, or 2.2 degrees Fahrenheit. The plan calls on the government to stop trying to make automobiles more fuel efficient and to block states from adopting California’s stringent automobile pollution standards. Ms. Furchtgott-Roth said any measures the United States would take to cut carbon would be undermined by rising emissions in countries like China, currently the planet’s biggest polluter. It would be impossible to convince China, to cut its emissions, she said. Mandy Gunasekara was chief of staff at the E.P.A. during the Trump administration and considers herself the force behind Mr. Trump’s decision to withdraw the United States from the 2015 Paris climate accord. She led the section outlining plans for that agency, and said that regarding whether carbon emissions pose a danger to human health “there’s a misconception that any of the science is a settled issue.”Bernard L. McNamee is a former Trump administration official who has worked as an adviser to fossil fuel companies as well as for the Texas Public Policy Foundation, which spreads misinformation about climate change. He wrote the section of the strategy covering the Department of Energy, which said the national laboratories have been too focused on climate change and renewable energy. In an interview, Mr. McNamee said he believes the role of the agency is to make sure energy is affordable and reliable. Mr. Dans said a mandate of Project 2025 is to “investigate whether the dimensions of climate change exist and what can actually be done.” As for the influence of burning fossil fuels, he said, “I think the science is still out on that quite frankly.” In actuality, it is not. The top scientists in the United States concluded in an exhaustive study produced during the Trump administration that humans — the cars we drive, the power plants we operate, the forests we destroy — are to blame. “There is no convincing alternative explanation supported by the extent of the observational evidence,” scientists wrote. Climate advocates said the Republican strategy would take the country in the wrong direction even as heat waves, drought and wildfires worsen because of emissions. “This agenda would be laughable if the consequences of it weren’t so dire,” said Christy Goldfuss, chief policy impact officer for the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group. Republicans who have called for their party to accept climate change said they were disappointed by the blueprint and worried about the direction of the party. “I think its out-of-touch Beltway silliness and it’s not meeting Americans where they are,” said Sarah Hunt, president of the Joseph Rainey Center for Public Policy, which works with Republican state officials on energy needs.She called efforts to repeal the Inflation Reduction Act, which is pouring money and jobs overwhelmingly into red states, particularly impractical. “Obviously as conservatives we’re concerned about fiscal responsibility, but if you look at what Republican voters think, a lot of Republicans in red states show strong support for provisions of the I.R.A.,” Ms. Hunt said. Representative John Curtis, Republican of Utah, who launched a conservative climate caucus, called it “vital that Republicans engage in supporting good energy and climate policy.” Without directly commenting on the G.O.P. blueprint, Mr. Curtis said “I look forward to seeing the solutions put forward by the various presidential candidates and hope there is a robust debate of ideas to ensure we have reliable, affordable and clean energy.” Benji Backer, executive chairman and founder of the American Conservation Coalition, a group of young Republicans who want climate action, said he felt Project 2025 was wrongheaded. “If they were smart about this issue they would have taken approach that said ‘the Biden administration has done things in a way they don’t agree with but here’s our vision’,” he said. “Instead they remove it from being a priority.” He noted climate change is a real concern among young Republicans. By a nearly two-to-one margin, polls have found, Republicans aged 18 to 39 years old are more likely to agree that “human activity contributes a great deal to climate change,” and that the federal government has a role to play in curbing it. Of Project 2025, he said, “This sort of approach on climate is not acceptable to the next generation.”",Liberal
New York Times,"Antarctic Sea Ice Is at a ‘Very Concerning’ Record Low. It’s winter in the Southern Hemisphere, when ice typically forms around Antarctica. But this year, that growth has been stunted, hitting a record low by a wide margin. The sharp drop in sea ice is alarming scientists and raising concerns about its vital role in regulating ocean and air temperatures, circulating ocean water and maintaining an ecosystem crucial for everything from microscopic plankton to the continent’s iconic penguins. “This year is really different,” said Ted Scambos, a senior research scientist at the University of Colorado Boulder and an Antarctica expert at the National Snow and Ice Data Center. “It’s a very sudden change.” A continued decline in Antarctic sea ice would have global consequences by exposing more of the continent’s ice sheet to the open ocean, allowing it to melt and break off more easily, contributing to rising sea levels that affect coastal populations around the world. Less ice also means less protection from solar rays, which can raise the water temperature, making it harder for ice to form. At the end of June, ice covered 4.5 million square miles, or 11.7 million square kilometers, of ocean around the continent, according to NSIDC data. That’s nearly a million square miles less than the expected average from approximately 40 years of satellite observations. The clear departure from previous years is startling, since sea ice around Antarctica has been slower to respond to climate change than ice in the Arctic Ocean. Antarctic sea ice also set a record low in 2022, but this year’s ice cover is almost half a million square miles smaller. “The Antarctic sea ice extent low in 2023 is unprecedented in the satellite record,” Liping Zhang, a project scientist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory, wrote in an email. The record low might signal a shift in the sea ice system to a new, unstable state where extremes become more common, but Dr. Zhang cautioned that scientists are still investigating this question. Sea ice around Antarctica typically freezes from February to August and then melts until the next Southern Hemisphere winter. Several ocean and atmosphere patterns influence how much ice grows or shrinks, and the overlapping interactions between these forces are complicated. On top of these natural, short-term patterns is the long-term influence of humans burning fossil fuels that add greenhouse gases to the atmosphere. Some researchers suspect that we are finally seeing the effects of this slow burn on Antarctica’s previously resilient sea ice. This year’s change, within the context of several years in a row with less sea ice, is “very, very concerning,” said Marilyn Raphael, a geography professor and director of the Institute of the Environment and Sustainability at University of California, Los Angeles. “That is not within natural variability,” she said. Dr. Raphael has been working to extend the historical record of Antarctic sea ice past the 1970s, when satellite observations began. She and her colleagues recently published a new data set going back to 1905, using weather observations to reconstruct the extent of sea ice during earlier years. While it’s still limited data, the longer record captures more cycles of natural variability. Dr. Raphael and other experts think that the ocean, which warms up more slowly than the atmosphere and has absorbed much of the heat from the burning of fossil fuels, may have reached a point where that heat is affecting Antarctic sea ice. Sea surface temperatures have broken records this year, and there are currently three patches of unusually warm water around Antarctica. While other factors are also at play, these hot spots line up with the areas on the coast where sea ice has been unusually slow to form, said Dr. Scambos. The sea ice’s decline is causing real consequences both locally and globally. Both of Antarctica’s native penguin species rely on sea ice. In some parts of the continent, Adélie penguins eat exclusively krill, a tiny crustacean that thrives in icy water. Less sea ice means less krill and less food for Adélies. Larger emperor penguins, recently listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act, depend even more directly on sea ice: they lay their eggs and raise their young on these floating habitats. When sea ice melts earlier in the season, before emperor penguin chicks develop waterproof adult feathers, the chicks can drown. Sea ice also serves as a protective, frozen moat around Antarctica — shielding the continental ice sheet and its glaciers, which have already been destabilized by climate change, from the warmer ocean and the eroding force of wind and waves. If this shield disappears, more land ice could flow or fall into the ocean, though some of this loss could be counterbalanced by more snow falling onto the continent. The amount of ice Antarctica loses to the ocean is one of the biggest factors in determining sea level rise. Even when Antarctic sea ice reaches its maximum extent around September, it could remain at a record low for that time of year, said Xiaojun Yuan, a research scientist at Columbia University’s Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, who maintains a seasonal forecast of Antarctic sea ice. Dr. Yuan’s forecast shows less sea ice than usual around most of Antarctica at least through early 2024.",Liberal
New York Times,"A Desperate Push to Save Florida’s Coral: Get It Out of the Sea. When Bailey Thomasson first spotted the coral, she felt a jolt of relief. She was diving for samples off the Florida Keys, and the thicket of elkhorn coral below looked brown, not the stark white that would indicate bleaching from the record-breaking sea temperatures in the area. But as she swam closer, she realized the situation was far worse than she’d considered possible. “The coral didn’t even have a chance to bleach, it just died,” said Ms. Thomasson, who works for the Coral Restoration Foundation, a nonprofit group based in the Keys. The brown color was not healthy coral but dead tissue sloughing off the skeleton, almost as if it had melted. “It just felt like, ‘Oh my God, we’re in the apocalypse,’” she said. “What’s happening?” With climate change ravaging Florida’s beloved reef, people who’ve devoted their careers to restoring coral in the sea are now racing to get it out of the water, to tanks on land. They’re pushing through feelings of grief and fear over the future to save what genetic material and young corals they can. But in the background, an existential question looms: How can they restore reefs if the ocean is getting too hot for coral to live there? While marine heat waves occur naturally, the eye-popping sea temperatures recorded off the Keys this month (one reading hit 101 degrees Fahrenheit, or just over 38 Celsius) have been made worse by global warming, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The world’s oceans have absorbed 90 percent of the additional heat unleashed by people burning fossil fuels and razing forests. Currently, about 44 percent of the global ocean is in a heat wave. The mass coral bleaching happening throughout the Keys is the most severe in the state’s history, Derek Manzello, the coordinator of NOAA’s Coral Reef Watch program, said. Surveys over the next few months are needed to understand how much coral has died. “I fear for the worst,” he said. Ms. Thomasson and her colleagues discovered that day, July 20, that all the coral at their acre-wide restoration plot at Sombrero Reef, about five nautical miles south of Marathon, Fla., was dead or so severely bleached that it was almost certain to die. The next day, she headed out with her team to check on their Looe Key coral nursery, a site that they’d carefully built out over the last two years off Big Pine Key. In May, they’d met a goal of installing 100 coral-nursery structures there. Now, as they approached by boat, they could see the white of the bleached coral below. The team embraced in a group hug before jumping in. When they resurfaced, Ms. Thomasson called her boss, crying so hard that at first he couldn’t understand her. “Everything in Looe Key is lost,” she told him, some 5,400 pieces of elkhorn and staghorn coral. The two sites appear to be among the hardest hit. But throughout Florida’s reef, which stretches some 350 miles, scientists and advocates are doing triage. First priority has been salvaging samples of the most threatened species of coral. Before the marine heat wave, there were only about 150 genetic individuals of elkhorn and 300 of staghorn left in the whole state. (Coral can reproduce asexually, making clones of themselves, so separate corals can have the same genes.) Divers fanned out across the reef and offshore nurseries, collecting two fragments of each genetic individual. Those were taken to tanks in holding facilities, then loaded onto trailers and driven to two separate locations that will serve as gene banks. It’s a “last-ditch sort of insurance policy,” said Jennifer Moore, who is leading the banking effort and coordinates protected coral recovery for NOAA Fisheries’ Southeast region. “God forbid everything dies in the water, we still have not lost those individuals.” Coral reefs occur in less than 1 percent of the ocean, but about 25 percent of all marine life depends on them at some point, including fish that provide a critical source of protein to millions of people. Reefs also protect shorelines from storms, breaking the energy of waves by an average of 97 percent, researchers have found. Worldwide, the goods and services provided by reefs have been valued at $2.7 trillion a year. Yet they are imperiled. In 2018, the United Nations’ scientific panel on climate change noted that the fate of coral reefs hangs in the balance between a global temperature increase of 1.5 degrees Celsius and a rise of 2 degrees Celsius. The smaller figure would cause further declines of 70 to 90 percent, the scientists said. The larger one would bring losses of more than 99 percent. While migration can help animals and plants adapt to a warming planet, coral reefs require very specific ocean conditions and take decades, centuries or millenniums to build. The pace of climate change is too fast, Phanor Montoya-Maya, a marine biologist with the Coral Restoration Foundation, said. Without drastic reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, the world is on track to warm 2.1 to 2.9 degrees by 2100, according to the United Nations. Stressed corals bleach, meaning they expel the algae that give them color and nourishment. If conditions don’t improve, or if bleaching happens too frequently, the corals will die. Mass bleaching events were unheard-of a half century ago, but they’ve been increasing in frequency and severity since the 1980s. By some estimates, the world has lost half of its coral cover since 1950. The coral reefs of the Florida Keys have suffered a sharp decline since the late 1970s, primarily because of disease and bleaching, both of which are directly linked to increasing ocean temperatures, Dr. Manzello said. “You talk about canaries in the coal mine,” he said. “These canaries have been dying now for 40 years.” The losses have inspired scientists and enthusiasts to intervene, propelling the field of coral restoration. Ken Nedimyer, for example, stepped away from a successful business as a tropical fish wholesaler some 20 years ago to throw himself into growing staghorn and elkhorn coral in offshore nurseries and planting them on Florida’s reef. He went on to found Coral Restoration Foundation and then a newer nonprofit group, Reef Renewal USA, which he still runs. He has dealt with bleaching and hurricanes before, but these past couple of weeks have been the most harrowing. “It’s gut-wrenching, it’s devastating,” he said. Ms. Thomasson and her team had been seeing signs of recovery at the sites they tend to. The coral there were having babies, a sign of good health. They were filled with hope. But after last month, it’s as if the clock had been reset, she said. “The good thing is that we have the skill set,” she said. “But how do we make it survive in the long term? How do we make it matter?” Mr. Nedimyer echoed that sentiment. “The question becomes, ‘How do you keep doing it?’” he said. “And the answer is, ‘How do you not keep doing it?’”",Liberal
New York Times,"101°F in the Ocean Off Florida: Was It a World Record? Measuring and comparing sea surface temperatures is complex, but scientists agree on one thing: A high reading this week is bad news for wildlife.The reading from a buoy off Florida this week was stunning: 101.1 degrees Fahrenheit, or just over 38 Celsius, a possible world record for sea surface temperatures and a stark indication of the brutal marine heat wave that’s threatening the region’s sea life. But determining whether that reading was in fact a world record is complicated. First things first: The buoy’s reading is so off-the-charts, could it have been malfunctioning? Allyson Gantt of the National Park Service, which monitors and maintains the buoy, said there was no reason to doubt the measurement. The data was consistent with high water temperatures seen in the area, Florida Bay, between the southern end of the Florida mainland and the Florida Keys, in recent weeks, she said. Then, there’s the fact that there is no official keeper of ocean temperature records. The World Meteorological Organization tracks land surface temperature records, but not ones set at sea. Experts have pointed to a reading of 99.7 degrees Fahrenheit, recorded in the middle of Kuwait Bay in 2020 and reported in a 2020 research paper, as the world record to date.Still, comparing the Kuwait reading, taken in the open sea, to a reading in shallow waters off the coast of Florida could be tricky. Just like it’s easier to heat up a shallow bath than a deep one, the depth of the water is going to affect temperatures, said Jeff Masters, a former hurricane scientist with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and a co-founder of Weather Underground, a Web-based weather service.“And maybe your buoy is near a river and there is a discharge from the river,” he said. “Or, in the case of the Everglades, there’s a lot of seaweed in the water.” Organic matter like seaweed means more dark surfaces, which are going to absorb more heat. “So a lot of complications when you’re talking near the shore,” Dr. Masters said.Out in the open ocean, it’s rare for surface temperatures to rise above roughly 90 degrees Fahrenheit, beyond which the water usually evaporates, said Frank Edgar Muller-Karger, a professor at the College of Marine Science at the University of South Florida. “But when you get to very, very shallow water, like over a coral reef or in a puddle of water, you can get up over that,” he said. “The sunlight is heating the water so much that it just can’t evaporate quickly enough.”Whether or not temperatures off Florida broke a world record, 100 degrees is an alarming reading for seawater. Many parts of the country have broken or tied temperature records this month, and a warm front that’s making its way across the country is expected bring more dangerously hot weather in coming days. Scientists said on Tuesday that extreme temperatures recorded this month in the Southwestern United States, as well as southern Europe and northern Mexico, would have been “virtually impossible” without the influence of human-caused climate change. Oceans have absorbed about 90 percent of the additional heat caused by humans as the world burns fossil fuels and destroy forests. When sea temperatures rise too high, it causes corals to expel the algae they need for sustenance, a process known as bleaching. Corals typically experience the most heat stress in August and September. But the recent heat means they’re now becoming stressed much earlier in the year. If waters don’t cool quickly enough, or if bleaching events happen in rapid succession, the corals can die. By some estimates, the world has already lost half of its coral reefs since 1950. Globally, 44 percent of the world’s oceans are experiencing a marine heat wave, according to NOAA, including areas off the East Coast of Canada and in the Mediterranean. And in Florida, as Dr. Masters put it: “If you took a dip in Manatee Bay, it would feel like a hot tub.” Ms. Gantt of the National Park Service pointed to some good news: Sea temperatures are still decreasing by as much as 10 degrees at night, and salinity levels are lower at this time of year than they have been in many previous years. Both help to relieve some of the stress on local marine life. That was a reminder of the important role the Everglades played in sending clean, fresh water into Florida Bay, she said.",Liberal
New York Times,"This Looks Like Earth’s Warmest Month. Hotter Ones Appear to Be in Store. July is on track to break all records for any month, scientists say, as the planet enters an extended period of exceptional warmth.Weeks of scorching summer heat in North America, Europe, Asia and elsewhere are putting July on track to be Earth’s warmest month on record, the European Union climate monitor said on Thursday, the latest milestone in what is emerging as an extraordinary year for global temperatures. Last month, the planet experienced its hottest June since records began in 1850. July 6 was its hottest day. And the odds are rising that 2023 will end up displacing 2016 as the hottest year. At the moment, the eight warmest years on the books are the past eight. “The extreme weather which has affected many millions of people in July is unfortunately the harsh reality of climate change and a foretaste of the future,” Petteri Taalas, the secretary general of the World Meteorological Organization, said in a statement. “The need to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions is more urgent than ever before.” The world has entered what forecasters warn could be a multiyear period of exceptional warmth, one in which the warming effects of humankind’s continuing emissions of heat-trapping gases are compounded by El Niño, the recurring climate pattern typically associated with hotter conditions in many regions.Even so, when global average temperatures shatter records by such large margins, as they have been doing since early June, it raises questions about whether the climate is also being shaped by other factors, said Karen A. McKinnon, a climate scientist and statistician at the University of California, Los Angeles. These elements might be less-well understood than global warming and El Niño.“Do we expect, given those two factors, the record to be broken by this much? Or is this a case where we don’t expect it?” Dr. McKinnon said. “Is there some other factor that we’re seeing come into play?” Many parts of the world are continuing to swelter this week as July enters its final days. In the United States, a dangerous heat wave was taking shape on Thursday in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic, the National Weather Service said, and high temperatures remained a concern in the Southwest and Central States. It’s been scorching in parts of North Africa, Southeastern Europe and Turkey. Wildfires, amplified by heat and dryness, have raged in Canada and around the Mediterranean. Researchers who analyzed this month’s punishing heat waves in the Southwestern United States, northern Mexico and Southern Europe said this week that the temperatures observed in those regions, over a span of so many days, would have been “virtually impossible” without the influence of human-driven climate change.Still, scientists will need to investigate further to fully understand the “alarming” extent to which the entire surface of the planet has, on average, been hotter than usual this summer, said Emily Becker, a climate scientist at the University of Miami. Fossil-fuel emissions, which cause heat to build up near Earth’s surface, are certainly playing a role. Since the Industrial Revolution, humans have pumped 1.6 trillion tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. This has caused the world to be about 1.2 degrees Celsius, or 2.2 Fahrenheit, warmer than it was in the second half of the 19th century. But the way this extra heat is distributed around the globe is still shaped by a complex brew of factors spanning land, sea and air, plus a certain amount of random chance. Which is why untangling the specific factors behind this summer’s severe heat will take time, Dr. Becker said. “There’s going to need to be quite a lot of research to understand it, and understand if we’re going to be seeing this again next year or 10 years from now.” One factor that probably hasn’t been very important so far this summer, at least not in North America, is El Niño, Dr. Becker said. The cyclical phenomenon emerges when the surface of the central tropical Pacific is hotter than normal. Its arrival, which this year occurred in late spring, triggers a cascade of changes to wind patterns and rainfall around the globe. But its most immediate effects are felt in the tropical and far western Pacific, in places like Indonesia.“In terms of North America, this El Niño is really just getting started,” said Dr. Becker, who contributes to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s El Niño and La Niña forecasts. Winter is when North America experiences El Niño’s most prominent effects, including wetter conditions in the Southern United States. This summer’s record heat could still affect the way this El Niño plays out later this year and into 2024, Dr. Becker said. Large areas of the planet’s oceans have been warmer than average. If this continues into fall and winter, it could lead to even stronger storms, with even heavier rain, in places that typically receive more storms during El Niño, Dr. Becker said. When it comes to factors besides global warming that may also be worsening heat waves, scientists have been examining potential changes in the jet streams, the rivers of air that influence weather systems around the planet. In the Northern Hemisphere, the differences in temperature between the Arctic and the Equator keep the subtropical jet stream moving. As humans warm the planet, those temperature differences are narrowing, which could be causing the jet stream to weaken and hot spells to last longer. So far, though, the evidence for this is inconclusive, said Tim Woollings, a professor of physical climate science at the University of Oxford. “It’s really not clear that the jet has been getting weaker,” he said. In a study published in April, Dr. Woollings and four other scientists found that human-caused warming might have shifted the jet streams in both hemispheres toward the poles in recent decades. More research is needed to understand this potential shift, he said. But if it continues, it could make subtropical regions susceptible to greater heat and drought, he said.",Liberal
New York Times,"Warming Could Push the Atlantic Past a ‘Tipping Point’ This Century. The last time there was a major slowdown in the mighty network of ocean currents that shapes the climate around the North Atlantic, it seems to have plunged Europe into a deep cold for over a millennium. That was roughly 12,800 years ago, when not many people were around to experience it. But in recent decades, human-driven warming could be causing the currents to slow once more, and scientists have been working to determine whether and when they might undergo another great weakening, which would have ripple effects for weather patterns across a swath of the globe. A pair of researchers in Denmark this week put forth a bold answer: A sharp weakening of the currents, or even a shutdown, could be upon us by century’s end. It was a surprise even to the researchers that their analysis showed a potential collapse coming so soon, one of them, Susanne Ditlevsen, a professor of statistics at the University of Copenhagen, said in an interview. Climate scientists generally agree that the Atlantic circulation will decline this century, but there’s no consensus on whether it will stall out before 2100. Which is why it was also a surprise, Dr. Ditlevsen said, that she and her co-author were able to pin down the timing of a collapse at all. Scientists are bound to continue studying and debating the issue, but Dr. Ditlevsen said the new findings were reason enough not to regard a shutdown as an abstract, far-off concern. “It’s now,” she said. The new research, published on Tuesday in the journal Nature Communications, adds to a growing body of scientific work that describes how humankind’s continued emissions of heat-trapping gases could set off climate “tipping points,” or rapid and hard-to-reverse changes in the environment. In the Atlantic, researchers have been searching for harbingers of tipping-point-like change in a tangle of ocean currents that goes by an unlovely name: the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation, or AMOC. These currents carry warm waters from the tropics through the Gulf Stream, past the southeastern United States, before bending toward northern Europe. When this water releases its heat into the air farther north, it becomes colder and denser, causing it to sink to the deep ocean and move back toward the Equator. This sinking effect, or “overturning,” allows the currents to transfer enormous amounts of heat around the planet, making them hugely influential for the climate around the Atlantic and beyond. As humans warm the atmosphere, however, the melting of the Greenland ice sheet is adding large amounts of fresh water to the North Atlantic, which could be disrupting the balance of heat and salinity that keeps the overturning moving. A patch of the Atlantic south of Greenland has cooled conspicuously in recent years, creating a “cold blob” that some scientists see as a sign that the system is slowing. Were the circulation to tip into a much weaker state, the effects on the climate would be far-reaching, though scientists are still examining their potential magnitude. Much of the Northern Hemisphere could cool. The coastlines of North America and Europe could see faster sea-level rise. Northern Europe could experience stormier winters, while the Sahel in Africa and the monsoon regions of Asia would most likely get less rain. Evidence from ice and sediment cores indicates that the Atlantic circulation underwent abrupt stops and starts in the deep past. But scientists’ most advanced computer models of the global climate have produced a wide range of predictions for how the currents might behave in the coming decades, in part because the mix of factors that shape them is so complex. Dr. Ditlevsen’s new analysis focused on a simple metric, based on sea-surface temperatures, that is similar to ones other scientists have used as proxies for the strength of the Atlantic circulation. She conducted the analysis with Peter Ditlevsen, her brother, who is a climate scientist at the University of Copenhagen’s Niels Bohr Institute. They used data on their proxy measure from 1870 to 2020 to calculate statistical indicators that presage changes in the overturning. “Not only do we see an increase in these indicators,” Peter Ditlevsen said, “but we see an increase which is consistent with this approaching a tipping point.” They then used the mathematical properties of a tipping-point-like system to extrapolate from these trends. That led them to predict that the Atlantic circulation could collapse around midcentury, though it could potentially occur as soon as 2025 and as late as 2095. Their analysis included no specific assumptions about how much greenhouse-gas emissions will rise in this century. It assumed only that the forces bringing about an AMOC collapse would continue at an unchanging pace — essentially, that atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations would keep rising as they have since the Industrial Revolution. In interviews, several researchers who study the overturning applauded the new analysis for using a novel approach to predict when we might cross a tipping point, particularly given how hard it has been to do so using computer models of the global climate. But they voiced reservations about some of its methods, and said more work was still needed to nail down the timing with greater certainty. Susan Lozier, a physical oceanographer at Georgia Tech, said sea-surface temperatures in the North Atlantic near Greenland weren’t necessarily influenced by changes in the overturning alone, making them a questionable proxy for inferring those changes. She pointed to a study published last year showing that much of the cold blob’s development could be explained by shifts in wind and atmospheric patterns. Scientists are now using sensors slung across the Atlantic to directly measure the overturning. Dr. Lozier is involved in one of these measurement efforts. The aim is to better understand what’s driving the changes beneath the waves, and to improve projections of future changes. But the projects began collecting data in 2004 at the earliest, which isn’t enough time to draw firm long-term conclusions. “It is extremely difficult to look at a short record for the ocean overturning and say what it is going to do over 30, 40 or 50 years,” Dr. Lozier said. Levke Caesar, a postdoctoral researcher studying the overturning at the University of Bremen in Germany, expressed concerns about the older temperature records that Dr. Ditlevsen and Dr. Ditlevsen used to compute their proxy. These records, from the late 19th and early 20th centuries, might not be reliable enough to be used for fine-toothed statistical analysis without careful adjustments, she said. Still, the new study sent an urgent message about the need to keep collecting data on the changing ocean currents, Dr. Caesar said. “There is something happening, and it’s likely out of the ordinary,” she said. “Something that wouldn’t have happened if it weren’t for us humans.” Scientists’ uncertainty about the timing of an AMOC collapse shouldn’t be taken as an excuse for not reducing greenhouse-gas emissions to try to forestall it, she and other researchers said. Instead, they said, it was a clarion call to action. “We’re playing Russian roulette with the climate system,” Dr. Caesar said. “And every year we add more greenhouse gases to the atmosphere, we’re putting another bullet in the chamber.”",Liberal
National Review,"The Biden administration and the governor of Hawaii claim it did. ABC News throws some water on this theory: Not only do “fire hurricanes” not exist, but climate change can’t be blamed for the number of people who died in the wildfires. Globally, climate change “nudged” the conditions that contribute to making wildfires more severe, but it is unclear how much of a role that played in the Maui fire event, Gavin Schmidt, director of the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies, told ABC News. Moreover, wildfires have the “lowest confidence” among natural disasters that researchers attribute to climate change, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. “We should not look to the Maui wildfires as a poster child of the link to climate change,” Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at the University of California, Los Angeles, said Friday in a YouTube stream. . . . The weather and environmental factors involved with the Maui wildfire event are more complex, Swain said. Natural climate variability in Hawaii is very large and picking out the human-induced climate change signs is really difficult, Abby Frazier, a climatologist at Clark University in Worcester, Massachusetts, told ABC News. Later, you find out that “the main factor driving the fires involved the invasive grasses that cover huge parts of Hawaii, which are extremely flammable.” What caused the fire in the first place? Likely a spark from Hawaiian Electric’s poorly protected power lines. That’s the same power company that invested in a green-energy transition rather than wildfire protection. The Wall Street Journal reports: During the 2019 wildfire season, one of the worst Maui had ever seen, Hawaiian Electric concluded that it needed to do far more to prevent its power lines from emitting sparks. The utility examined California’s plans to reduce fires ignited by power lines, started flying drones over its territory and vowed to take steps to protect its equipment and its customers from the threat of fire. Nearly four years later, the company has completed little such work. . . . At the end of 2019, Hawaiian Electric issued a press release about wildfire risk. It said it would install heavier, insulated conductors on Maui and Oahu to minimize the risk of sparks when winds picked up, as well as technology to detect disruptions when the conductors came into contact with vegetation or each other. It said it would apply fire retardant on poles in risky areas and consider installing cameras and other devices to monitor weather conditions during fire season. In filings over the next two years with the Hawaii Public Utilities Commission, which is tasked with approving utility projects and spending, the company made only passing reference to wildfire mitigation. And then there is this: Former regulators and energy company officials said the utility was focused at that time on procuring renewable energy. Hawaii has been on a push to convert to renewables since 2008, when a run-up in oil prices sent electrical rates at Hawaiian Electric—which relied on petroleum imports for 80% of its energy supply—through the roof. In 2015, lawmakers passed legislation mandating that the state derive 100% of its electricity from renewable sources by 2045, the first such requirement in the U.S. … “Looking back with hindsight, the business opportunities were on the generation side, and the utility was going out for bid with all these big renewable-energy projects,” he said. “But in retrospect, it seems clear, we weren’t as focused on these fire risks as we should have been.”",Conservative
National Review,"“Global warming is real, but it is not the end of the world.” Does that statement scandalize you? It surely scandalizes the climate-alarmist lobby. But that’s just the case Bjørn Lomborg lays out in the new cover story of National Review magazine. “Climate change is a real and man-made phenomenon,” Lomborg writes, “and it will have negative impacts overall. That’s a fact, and it is one that we hear a lot.” But the “catastrophe narrative” is “drowning out” the reality and the nuance of the problem — a problem that is at the end of the day manageable. In his cover-story essay, Lomborg presents the reader with eight charts that you need to see “to understand that the climate-change data are very different from what we hear in the commonplace narrative.” From the facts about hurricanes, to the resiliency of polar-bear populations, to the true cost of going to “net-zero” on carbon, Lomborg’s charts will surprise you, especially if all you’ve had to go on is the climate coverage on NPR or in the Washington Post. Has the science been politicized? Of course it has. And it’s part of an ongoing pattern. That pattern is what Christine Rosen covers in her essay, “Political Science.” When the science journal Nature took the unprecedented step of endorsing Joe Biden in the 2020 presidential race, it didn’t do much to move votes. But it did do damage to the public’s faith in the credibility of scientists. Stanford University researcher Floyd Zhang took a look at the endorsement’s effect on Trump voters. He found that “trust in the publication’s impartiality plummeted.” I’m not sure that Nature intended to produce a mistrust that “extended to those study participants’ views of science and scientists more broadly,” but that is all that its endorsement achieved.

WSJ,"Cities across the U.S. have found relief from this summer’s record-setting heat with the help of technologies that shield roofs, pavement and other surfaces from the sun’s scorching rays. Some of these technologies have been around for more than a decade but are experiencing greater demand as global temperatures rise. Washington, D.C., for example, has built more than 3,200 green roofs covering 9 million square feet—up from about 300,000 square feet in 2006, according to federal and city officials. Other technologies, such as super-reflective coatings for pavement, streets and windows, are just now becoming effective and affordable enough for widespread use. The Los Angeles neighborhood of Pacoima, a densely packed location sandwiched between freeways and an industrial area, has created a partnership with GAF, a New Jersey-based roofing manufacturer, to paint a basketball court, local park and neighborhood streets with a reflective coating. “There’s a lot of asphalt and lack of investment for tree canopies,” said Melanie Paola Torres, 24 years old, a community organizer with the group Pacoima Beautiful. “Given the fact that we are in an industrial zone, that contributes to the urban heat-island effect.” The reflective coating has reduced air temperatures in the test area at 6 feet above ground by 3.5 degrees Fahrenheit during extreme heat days, and surface temperatures by 10 degrees, according to Jeff Terry, GAF’s vice president of corporate social responsibility and sustainability. Sweltering conditions are worse in urban heat islands, which can be 10 degrees hotter than surrounding suburbs and occur as buildings, roads and other infrastructure absorb and re-emit the sun’s energy. Cooling technologies mitigate this. Green roofs absorb heat before it penetrates the buildings beneath. Super-reflective coatings reflect the sun’s visible light and invisible infrared radiation away from surfaces to keep them cooler. And an ultra-white paint developed at Purdue University promises even more protection, although the product isn’t commercially available yet. Each strategy helps reduce energy use. “The important thing is to help people cool their homes and workplaces affordably,” said Jane Gilbert, chief heat officer for Miami-Dade County, which experienced a record 46 straight days of a 100-degree-plus heat index this summer. “The more efficient we can make both the buildings and the AC systems themselves, the less we’re contributing both to greenhouse gases and also waste heat that goes to our urban heat islands.” Miami is one of the most vulnerable cities to the urban heat-island effect, along with San Francisco, New York, Chicago and Seattle, according to an analysis by Climate Central, a New Jersey-based nonprofit that researches the effects of climate change. Its analysis found that 41 million people living in 44 cities face an urban heat-island effect of at least 8 degrees. Nine U.S. cities had at least one million people exposed to urban heat of 8 degrees or higher because of the local built environment. To fight the heat, some cities are leveraging federal money and other incentives to persuade local builders to turn office buildings greener and cooler. In Miami-Dade County, officials used federal funds to outfit 1,700 public housing units with new low-energy air-conditioning units. Local officials also offered a successful amendment to the Florida state building code requiring cool reflective roofs on all new commercial buildings beginning in 2024, and enrolled 150 structures in a voluntary energy-audit program to track improvements to cut energy use and keep temperatures down. New York, Chicago, Philadelphia, Toronto and other cities are pushing green roofs with tax breaks and other incentives in an effort to lower energy bills and reduce ambient temperatures, according to Steven Peck, president of Green Roofs for Healthy Cities, a Toronto-based green-roof and -wall industry association. Peck said green roofs can be 30 to 40 degrees cooler than a similar-size blacktop roof, while also cutting waste heat from air-conditioning units. In the Los Angeles neighborhood of Pacoima, Torres says residents tell her the streets and playgrounds feel cooler since the reflective coating was completed in August 2022. “The number-one thing that always comes up is the heat waves when you’re looking down the street,” Torres said. “They don’t see those anymore.” The next step is to install reflective roofing material on a handful of homes as part of the neighborhood cooling effort. “We want to keep stacking the solutions to overall create a cool community with multiple strategies,” Torres said. Altering the urban landscape to adapt to extreme heat requires money and technical know-how, according to city leaders and academic experts. But they also acknowledge the need to keep people safe as global temperatures rise. “Any one solution is not going to necessarily be able to address the entire problem, but by systematically applying solutions that work in each individual location, we can make a dent in the urban heat-island effect,” said David Sailor, professor of geographical sciences and urban planning at Arizona State University.",Liberal
WSJ,"PELE ISLAND, Vanuatu—As she walked down a jungle path near her home around noon on a recent day, Winnie Batty expected to see nearly 30 graves remaining in the coastal cemetery where her grandparents were buried. Instead, she found only 10 among the trees. Some gravestones were mostly buried in sand, and several bones littered the ground. “After every cyclone, we have to collect bones,” she said. “Maybe if you come back next time, you can’t see all these graves anymore.” Earlier this year, two cyclones hit Vanuatu within days, further damaging the graveyard that for years has been steadily disappearing into the sea, Batty said. The geography and geology of the South Pacific archipelago has long made it vulnerable to natural disasters such as cyclones, earthquakes and volcanic eruptions. But locals couldn’t remember such back-to-back cyclones before. Few here question that the cause is climate change. But researchers say that while the broad trends are clear, proving that some specific event is a result of climate change is a challenge. For nations and scientists trying to tally up the costs of climate change, extreme weather events remain a problem. A link is easier to show for events with a wide geographical extent, such as large-scale heat waves, some researchers said. Establishing that climate change caused an individual cyclone to form or be more intense or grow more quickly is harder. Although some studies show climate change is reducing the frequency of tropical cyclones, scientists say the storms might have greater impact because of more intense rainfall and higher sea levels than before. “It’s very hard to put 100% certainty on very much,” said Michael Grose, who specializes in climate projections at Australia’s national science agency, the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation. “Event attributions are never as confident as that.” At a United Nations climate summit last year, countries agreed to set up a so-called loss-and-damage fund to help pay for sudden or irreparable destruction linked to climate change. A committee working out how the fund will operate is expected to present recommendations later this year. As the talks progress, scientific uncertainty about links between specific weather events and climate change could reduce public willingness in developed countries to pay for loss and damage in poorer nations. One group of researchers, called World Weather Attribution, is trying to produce studies while the impacts of extreme weather are fresh in the public’s mind, though the research isn’t immediately peer-reviewed. One of its studies was mixed on climate change’s role in recent flooding in Pakistan, while another found a very strong link to recent heat waves in the Northern Hemisphere. In the U.S., scientists say hurricanes have been intensifying faster, and that warmer ocean waters could play a role in turbocharging relatively weak storms into devastating ones. Hurricane Idalia, which just hit the U.S., appeared to strengthen quickly. One issue with the science of extreme-event attribution is a lack of baseline data—needed to prove change over time—for many developing countries, where there has been less funding for scientific research and record-keeping than in richer countries. To study slow-onset events like an island’s coastline erosion, for example, would require good models representing changes in sea level, said Friederike Otto, co-founder of World Weather Attribution and senior lecturer in climate science at the Grantham Institute in London. The attribution group’s researchers couldn’t assess the role of climate change in African rainfall that led to flooding and hundreds of deaths because they lacked weather-station data and climate models were unable to simulate the event, she said. Given the data limitations, some scientists, analysts and developing countries themselves argue that it is unfair to require nations seeking loss-and-damage funds to absolutely prove that specific weather events are tied to climate change. “I don’t think in any way you would need attribution science to unlock funding,” said Christopher Bartlett, who leads climate diplomacy for Vanuatu’s government. Adding to the complexity, he added, is that some areas are suffering compounding and intensifying impacts—such as more severe storms, rising sea levels and coral-killing ocean acidification—at the same time. As the biggest historic emitter of greenhouse gases, the U.S. is expected to lead efforts to provide climate finance for the developing world, and the Biden administration has said it is putting the climate crisis at the center of its foreign policy. In a recent exchange with a Republican lawmaker during a congressional hearing, U.S. climate envoy John Kerry said the U.S. wouldn’t pay climate reparations. But U.S. officials have said the fund wouldn’t create legal liability. Developed nations’ agreement to set up the fund last November was a diplomatic victory for small nations that have long sought for larger countries to do more to address climate change. Another landmark came in March, when the U.N. General Assembly agreed to seek an advisory opinion from the International Court of Justice, the U.N.’s highest court, on countries’ obligations under international law to protect the climate from greenhouse-gas emissions for future generations. Vanuatu campaigned for the U.N. court to take up the case. While the science underpinning climate change isn’t expected to be a point of contention, Vanuatu officials said they would try to show that recent disasters can be tied to global warming. Many Pacific nations say they have borne the brunt of climate change for years, and have low-lying islands at risk of being inundated as sea levels rise. Several could disappear entirely, sparking a discussion over whether their sovereignty can legally be maintained if the population has to move to another country. Although Vanuatu’s islands are mountainous, many villages are on the coast, making them similarly threatened by rising seas and shoreline-eroding floods. The country’s geography and largely agricultural society—most people depend on subsistence farming—make it particularly vulnerable to climate-change impacts. “A big issue now in Vanuatu is finding somewhere safe to live,” said Ralph Regenvanu, the country’s climate-change minister. The two cyclones that hit earlier this year, Judy and Kevin, affected 66% of the country’s roughly 300,000 people, according to a government report. Nearly 20,000 homes were damaged or destroyed across three hard-hit provinces. Although there were no fatalities, crop losses were substantial, fresh-food prices rose significantly, and 42% of people said they didn’t have enough to eat, the report said. Other destructive cyclones hit the country in 2015 and 2020. The 2015 cyclone, Pam, wiped out the equivalent of 64% of the country’s gross domestic product. This year’s double hit was hardest on the country’s southern areas—a region that includes remote Erromango Island, home to about 2,500 people. Residents there said the storms knocked out the banana crop, a key food source. A local school recently began providing rice for the students, out of concern the children weren’t getting enough to eat. Jason Mete, a chief in one area of Erromango, is preparing for the possibility of moving his community uphill, where he said it would be safer from flooding that is eroding the banks of a river that runs through his village. Last year, he said, a major flood destroyed gardens that people rely on for food, leaving bare dirt, and nearly washed away a government building. Studies have shown that “climate change is the real thing,” Mete said, adding that he believes there should be compensation for climate-related damage. Mike Tombu, another Erromango resident, said he was fortunate a large mango tree that fell during the storms didn’t hit his house. In a garden he keeps in the forest, Tombu said one of his sandalwood trees—an important income source for many locals—was damaged. But another, which he said is 22 years old and worth more than $800, was still standing. “I came in the morning and hugged this tree,” Tombu said. “I’m very lucky to have this still surviving.” Tombu said he is convinced the climate is shifting. The coastline, he said, was farther out to sea when he was younger. He said he’d like developed countries to build infrastructure that will help people move, though he added that all countries, not just developed nations, are responsible for pollution. “Maybe in 10, 20 years’ time, we will be sitting in deep pools here,” Tombu said as he sat along the riverbank. “So this village should evacuate.” Some residents are doing what they can to prepare. Wilson Lovo said the storms blew off his roof and damaged his gardens, forcing him to buy expensive imported rice to feed his family. He now is focusing on crops that he thinks can better survive fierce storms, including taro, a root vegetable. “I’m getting ready to face the climate that’s coming,” Lovo said as his cousin Joe helped him plant taro. “We faced the twin cyclone. Maybe this year, we face three or four.” Scientists say what will happen in Vanuatu is tied to a band of clouds called the South Pacific Convergence Zone, which could shift north or south. Depending on where it moves, and the extent of future greenhouse-gas emissions, Vanuatu’s future climate could be warmer and drier or hotter and much wetter. But all projections prepared in part by CSIRO show heavier or much heavier rainfall events and greater cyclone impacts. Almost all attribution studies conducted so far on tropical cyclones have looked at the rainfall associated with them, said Otto, the climate-attribution scientist. With two cyclones, researchers could look at the combined rainfall and analyze whether and to what extent the intensity and frequency of the rainfall changes, which would be relatively easy with state-of-the-art climate models, she said. It is unlikely an attribution study would find a link between climate change and the likelihood of back-to-back cyclones, given the research showing no increase in cyclone frequency, Otto said. But many studies have found an increase in rainfall tied to tropical cyclones, as well as more flooding because of rising sea levels, Otto said. On Vanuatu’s Pele Island, the community has started burying people in a new graveyard further inland. The gravestones include written histories of the deceased, so the coastal cemetery is an important way for young people to learn about their ancestors, Batty said. She is worried that the grave of her grandfather, one of the few remaining in the cemetery, will disappear in the coming years. Her grandmother’s grave washed away long ago. “I really love him, and I find it very hard to lose the grave,” she said of her grandfather. “Climate change is really affecting us.”",Liberal
Daily Progress,"Global Warming Could Make Pregnancies More Dangerous FRIDAY, Sept. 8, 2023 (HealthDay News) -- Global warming has been linked to higher rates of asthma, heart disease and other health concerns. Now, new research suggests that rising temperatures across the planet may place pregnant women at greater risk for severe pregnancy-related illnesses, especially in their third trimester.And this is likely to get worse in the near future, said study author Anqi Jiao, a Ph.D. student at the University of California, Irvine. “Climate change will continue to impact all facets of health with increasing severity and duration of extreme heat events,” she noted. Severe maternal illness is an umbrella term for 21 serious conditions that can include heart attacks, kidney failure, sudden cardiac arrest, heart failure, anesthesia complications, blood infections, and need for a hysterectomy (removal of the uterus), among other illnesses and complications. “These women… would have died without appropriate and timely identification and intervention, but severe pregnancy-related illnesses are thought to be preventable to a large extent,” Jiao said. What’s more, these conditions can result in longer-term treatment and recovery and place a greater financial burden on families, she added.Exactly how exposure to extreme heat causes serious pregnancy complications for expectant moms is not fully understood, but the researchers have some theories. Heat exposure may lead to dehydration and an imbalance of minerals in the blood, which can cause inflammation, increased heart rate and other symptoms, Jiao said.The study, published Sept. 7 in JAMA Network Open, included more than 403,000 pregnancies in Southern California from 2008 to 2018. Of these, there were 3,446 cases of severe pregnancy-related illnesses reported.Women who had the most exposure to extreme heat during their pregnancy had a 27% greater risk for experiencing a severe pregnancy-related illness, and pregnant women who were exposed to extreme heat during their third trimester had a 28% increased risk for severe illness, the study showed. Pregnant women with less education were also more vulnerable to heat exposure and related risks, the study showed.“Doctors and society may provide more instructions or help them understand the potential heat effect during their pregnancy and encourage them to take action to prevent themselves from extreme heat,” Jiao said.If you are pregnant during a heat wave, especially during the third trimester, take precautions to protect your health. This includes seeking shade when temperatures soar, Jiao said.Dr. Nathaniel DeNicola has spent his career studying the effects of the environment on pregnancy outcomes in moms and babies. He is an obstetrician-gynecologist at the Caduceus Medical Group in Yorba Linda and Irvine, Calif. and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists’ environmental health expert. The new study demonstrates that the timing of exposure to intense heat during pregnancy matters. “Extreme heat in the third trimester poses a greater risk for pregnant women, especially when it occurs in the week before delivery,” said DeNicola, who was not involved with the research. Women who are in their third trimester during the true dog days of summer typically conceive from November through April, based on where they live, he said. Women who are in their third trimester during the winter months tend to fare better, he said. There’s lots to do to stay a few steps ahead of severe heat-related illnesses during pregnancy. For starters, if you are pregnant during a heat wave, drink more water. “There is no exact amount of water that I recommend, but it’s important to stay well ahead of thirst,” DeNicola said. Look for ways to cool down during the day when the heat index is at its highest. “If you don’t have air conditioning where you live, consider cooling centers, museums or other public indoor spaces,"" DeNicola said.He also tells pregnant women to download the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration-National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health heat index app. “This app can let you know when it is safe to be outside or exercise outdoors and when it isn’t,” he noted. Know the signs of heat exhaustion, DeNicola added.“These come on before heat stroke and can be subtle but accelerate rapidly,” he said. Signs include sweating, thirst, headache, muscle weakness, cramps, dizziness and nausea.“These are early signs of heat exhaustion that tell you it’s time to find ways to cool down,” DeNicola noted.",Liberal
WSJ,"July was Earth’s hottest month on record, surpassing the global monthly average temperature record set in July 2019, according to data from the Copernicus Climate Change Service, a European Union-funded scientific agency. The heat blanketed parts of North America, Asia and Europe as wildfires blazed in Greece and Canada, hitting economies. Water shortages and high humidity affected parts of the Middle East. Residents in China contended with both extreme flooding and a heat wave as the country set a new national temperature record. All this came on the heels of the world’s hottest June on record. Parts of the U.S. experienced record-breaking heat as well. July was the warmest month on record for states such as Arizona and New Mexico, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said Tuesday. Agency data also show that more than 3,000 daily temperature records were broken or tied across the country last month. Even cities in typically colder areas such as Alaska experienced unprecedentedly high temperatures. July is always, on average, the hottest month of the year annually, but these temperature records represent merely the newest iteration of what has become a notable pattern over the past decade. The world experienced the eight warmest years on record globally from 2015 through 2022, the World Meteorological Organization reported earlier this year. The global ocean, too, is part of this pattern: Roughly, the last 10 years were among the ocean’s warmest since at least the 1800s, and the Copernicus agency, a division of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, found that global sea-surface temperatures remained at record-high levels last month.  “What seems unprecedented this year now will just be normal a few years from now,” said Tapio Schneider, a California Institute of Technology climate scientist.  Heat waves have become quotidian problems in the summer. And this year, much as in 2016, a powerful El Niño weather pattern developing in the Pacific has liberated heat from the ocean depths, redistributing it into the atmosphere, amplifying the effects of climate change driven by fossil-fuel emissions. The Wall Street Journal looked at some of the cities around the world that are among those that have been affected in different ways by rising temperatures. Excessive heat is the No. 1 weather-related killer in the U.S., according to the National Weather Service. High temperatures can be a risk to anyone, public-health experts say. But those in vulnerable groups are especially at risk, including the elderly, infants and people with pre-existing conditions, such as cardiovascular or pulmonary diseases. A study published recently found the risk for heart attack doubles during heat waves that last several days and overlap with periods of poor air quality. Phoenix residents endured a record stretch of it in July, when daytime temperatures hit 110 degrees or above for 31 consecutive days—the hottest month ever in a U.S. city. Phoenix also clocked a record 16-day stretch when the temperatures didn’t go below 90 degrees at night. That nighttime heat has been responsible for a growing number of heat-related deaths. So far this year, Maricopa County, where Phoenix is located, has recorded 39 heat-associated deaths and is investigating another 312, according to the most recent weekly report from the public-health department. There were a record 425 heat-associated deaths in 2022, a 25% increase from the previous year, according to Maricopa’s public-health department. Sonia Singh, spokeswoman for Maricopa’s public-health department, said it is hard to pinpoint exactly what caused the jump because so many factors can play into a heat-associated death, including a person’s housing situation, substance use and access to healthcare. “This is a lot more than we’re used to,” Singh said of the recent and unusually long spate of extreme temperatures. “Everybody needs to have a plan for where they can go to escape the heat.” Even places such as Arizona that routinely experience extreme heat have struggled to get people to pay attention to the risks, according to Kristie Ebi, a professor who researches health risks in a changing climate at the University of Washington’s Center for Health and the Global Environment. “You talk with people who say, ‘Oh, I can remember heat waves from a couple of years ago…was fine.’” she said “Today’s hot isn’t hot five years ago—it is a different hot and that is not easy to communicate.” Heat-related deaths in the U.S. have been on the rise for the last five years, data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention show. The agency, on average, has recorded some 1,200 deaths each year from 2018 to 2022. The agency said that better reporting might be a factor, particularly as people have become more aware of how heat can contribute to death cases. In contrast, heart disease, the leading cause of death in the U.S., sees hundreds of thousands of deaths recorded each year by the agency. Ebi said the number of heat deaths is “massively underestimated,” and that the real number is closer to 10,000 when factoring in people who died of things such as heart issues brought on by heat. “Heat is underlying so many people going into emergency room departments and dying during heat waves,” she said. “But death certificates aren’t recording what today’s temperature was.” Heat has an outsize impact on urban areas. In cities such as New York, where asphalt, cement and buildings absorb heat, it will not only feel hotter during the day, but also at night, when a lot of that heat is released, according to Ebi. The compact, built-out environments of densely populated cities help create pockets known as heat islands, which experience temperatures that can be several degrees higher than surrounding rural areas. Many elements of city life contribute to this effect, including traffic, industrial facilities, and the heating and cooling of buildings. “Think about people who have window air conditioners, and you know the way they work is they take heat from the inside and they dump it outside,” Ebi said. “Air conditioners can make cities hotter as well.” More than two-thirds of residents in New York City experience at least 8 degrees Fahrenheit more heat due to the effect, according to the New Jersey-based nonprofit Climate Central.  City data on the relative risk from extreme-heat events show that residents of the south Bronx, upper Manhattan and central Brooklyn are the most vulnerable. In Brooklyn, Borough President Antonio Reynoso said the vulnerability is largely concentrated in communities of color, including East New York, East Flatbush and Brownsville. City officials have said they hope to address the extreme-heat problem by, among other things, developing a maximum indoor summer temperature policy by 2030 and planting more trees and expanding the tree canopy cover to 30% from 22%. Tourists saw their vacations soured by heat waves and wildfires across the Mediterranean last month. Greece experienced a 15-day heat wave—its longest on record, according to Lagouvardos Kostas, meteorologist and research director at the National Observatory of Athens. Temperatures as high as 110 degrees Fahrenheit fried the capital, prompting city officials to intermittently close outdoor archaeological sites such as the Acropolis. “It is an open space. It is very exposed to the sun, you have to work to climb to go there too,” Kostas said of the Acropolis. “It’s not an easy task to do it even in fine weather.” Officials encouraged tourists and residents to limit their time outside. Some workers were given the option to telecommute rather than risk developing health conditions such as heat stroke, he added. Spain and Italy were among other Mediterranean countries experiencing extreme heat. Catania, in Sicily, saw temperatures exceed 120 degrees Fahrenheit midmonth. Europe experienced a similarly scorching and deadly summer in 2022.  There were more than 61,000 heat-related deaths on the continent between the end of May and beginning of September last year, according to a recent study published in the journal Nature Medicine. Mortality was highest in places such as Italy and Greece, and vacationers trying to beat the heat by traveling elsewhere may be taking an economic toll. The number of European tourists planning to travel to Mediterranean destinations dropped by 10% compared with last year, according to a European Travel Commission survey. Kostas said wildfires burning across Greece—exacerbated by the extreme heat—and the associated smoke are affecting tourism. Multiple blazes forced evacuations in areas south of Athens and on the popular island destination of Rhodes. He added that prolonged, higher temperatures and dry conditions have made the fires larger and more difficult to control. Taps are running dry in Tehran as millions in Iran and neighboring Iraq face water shortages that are being compounded by the effects of rising temperatures. “In Iran they are wrestling over the available water,” said Charles Iceland, director for freshwater initiatives at the World Resources Institute, a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit. “They have been overexploiting groundwater, and they are actually using it faster than it is replenished.” Unsustainable use and management of water resources—to sate a growing population and economy—and inefficient irrigation practices have contributed to scarcity, Iceland said. Roughly 80% of water use goes to agriculture, according to Soroosh Sorooshian, a University of California, Irvine professor of civil and environmental engineering, who grew up in Iran and whose family was in the farming business. Farmers generally flood their land using open-air canals, and much of the water is lost to evaporation. As temperatures continue to rise, Iceland said, more of that irrigation water will be lost to evaporation—further taxing water resources. He added that mid-latitude regions including Iran and Iraq are projected to get less rainfall over time as the Earth continues to warm, which may compound the area’s water-scarcity problems. A combination of high heat and humidity is an additional issue for the region’s beleaguered population. While temperature highs haven’t exceeded those of Europe and the southern U.S., researchers say subtropical regions near warm water, including the Middle East, are less hospitable even at the same temperatures. High humidity levels make it more difficult to sweat out excess body heat, preventing us from cooling down, exacerbating heat-related health effects. Scientists measure this heat-humidity combo using a metric known as the wet bulb temperature, which CalTech’s Schneider said “approximates what humans can survive.” If this metric exceeds about 95 degrees Fahrenheit, he said, “then humans can’t cool themselves efficiently anymore. Ultimately, you just die.” In recent weeks, residents in China’s capital and surrounding areas have been hit by a one-two punch of extreme heat and deadly flooding from record rainfall following Typhoon Doksuri.  The occurrence, intensity and duration of such events are affected by climate change, research shows. Rising temperatures result in increased precipitation. Ultimately the unpredictability of these events makes it harder to manage water, energy and other critical resources in a heavily urbanized country where people and valuable assets are densely clustered, according to Scott Moore, a University of Pennsylvania political scientist and director of China programs and strategic initiatives at the university. “There is a good argument that, of the world’s large economies, China is the most vulnerable to climate risk,” Moore said. An April study published in the journal Nature Communications identified the area around Beijing as being among the most at-risk for high-impact heat waves. The aftermath of Doksuri forced more than one million people in Beijing and surrounding areas to evacuate. Meanwhile, consistently high temperatures—Beijing registered a record number of days this year during which temperatures hit or exceeded 95 degrees Fahrenheit—strained electrical grids and exacerbated water shortages. A July report from China’s National Climate Center showed the rate of the country’s temperature rise has been higher than the rest of the world’s since the beginning of the 20th century. Extreme high temperature events have increased in frequency and intensity in about the last six decades, as well as a per-decade increase in China’s average annual precipitation during the same period. The biggest threat to Beijing, Moore said, is extreme rainfall that overwhelms the capital’s drainage system, which isn’t built to handle a growing volume of water. “There is a real irony of climate extremes here because the principal fear in Beijing has always been not enough water and desertification, but the images that we’re seeing have been absolutely terrifying flooding in the city,” said Jeremy Wallace, a professor of government at Cornell University who focuses on Chinese politics. Even the Arctic isn’t immune to rising temperatures in a warming world. The U.S.’s northernmost city, Utqiaġvik—formerly known as Barrow—north of the Arctic Circle in Alaska, just experienced its hottest July on record. Typically, summer temperatures hover between 40 and 50 degrees Fahrenheit, but on July 23, the daily average temperature hit a record high of 63.5 degrees. That record was just broken again, as the average temperature there on Saturday hit 66 degrees, according to Brian Brettschneider, a climate scientist at the National Weather Service Alaska region headquarters. “It used to be normal to have a couple inches of snow up there in July,” he said of Utqiaġvik. Other cities around the state, such as Northway, also had their warmest months on record in July. “The last two months have really been kind of big steps up” in a long-term, continuing warming trend worldwide, Brettschneider said, adding that he expects 2024 will be warmer than 2023. Not only does data show Alaska is the fastest warming state due to climate change, but its North Slope is among the fast-warming areas on Earth, Brettschneider said. “It is safe to say the Arctic warms at least twice as fast as the rest of the world,” he added. Loss of surrounding sea ice due to rising surface and ocean temperatures has decreased surfaces that act like a mirror for incoming heat from the sun, reflecting solar energy back into space, Brettschneider said. Now more of it is absorbed by the ocean, which further heats up and contributes to more ice melt as part of a feedback loop. This phenomenon is known as Arctic, or polar, amplification. Such ice melt can affect global ocean circulation, and the additional heat filters into the atmosphere, where it gets transported to lower latitudes, affecting sea levels and weather systems. “Warmth in Alaska doesn’t stay in Alaska,” he said.",Liberal
WSJ,"The extreme heat blanketing the southern regions of the U.S., Mexico, and Europe this month would have been nearly impossible without the warming effects of human-induced climate change, according to a study released Tuesday by a group of European scientists who carry out rapid assessments of extreme weather events. The study by World Weather Attribution, a group of researchers based in London and the Netherlands, found that three separate heat waves in July across the Northern Hemisphere were made much worse because of decades of fossil-fuel emissions that have raised the planet’s average temperature by 2 degrees Fahrenheit since the late 19th century. “It’s something that we definitely will see more of in the future,” said Friederike Otto, co-founder of World Weather Attribution, an author on the new study and a senior lecturer in climate science at the Grantham Institute in London. “We don’t know what the new normal or the new extreme will be in the future because we don’t know when we will stop burning fossil fuels.” The study hasn’t been peer-reviewed, which is considered the gold standard for validating research findings; however, it is based on peer-reviewed methods the group published in 2020. To assess the recent heat waves, the scientists ran a dozen climate models comparing the temperatures observed this month with projections of a similar world without climate warming. They concluded that without human-induced climate change, the extreme heat in China would have been about a one-in-250-year event, while the heat waves in July in the U.S., Mexico, and southern Europe would have been virtually impossible. For the past few years, global temperatures have been moderated by the cooling effects of a three-year La Niña weather pattern in the Pacific Ocean. Now, the Pacific is switching to its opposite pattern, known as El Niño, which brings warm water to the eastern Pacific and influences weather patterns across the globe. Last month was the world’s hottest June in the 174-year global climate record tracked by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. U.S. officials said recently that the first week of July was the hottest globally since record-keeping began in 1850, and expect the entire month will be the hottest ever, surpassing the previous hottest month of July 2016. “We anticipate that July is likely to be the warmest absolute month on record, and that’s going to be a record that effectively goes back many hundreds if not thousands of years,” said Gavin Schmidt, director of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York, during a press call last week. “We don’t see this every year.” Climate scientists have a good understanding of temperatures before record-keeping based on so-called proxy measures, which include the thickness of tree rings, lake and ocean sediments that record pollen from plants, ice cores taken from glaciers and ice sheets, corals, fossils and records from ship logs and early weather observers, according to NOAA. July’s extreme heat affected over 100 million people across the U.S. and dozens of people have suffered heat-related deaths along the border with Mexico and throughout Arizona, the study said. More than 200 heat-related fatalities have been reported in Mexico, half in the northern state of Nuevo Leon, the study said. Phoenix has suffered under 25 straight days of 110-degree-plus heat, a record for the city, forcing construction workers to pour concrete at night and cool materials with buckets of ice.",Liberal
Daily Progress,"Biden administration cancels remaining oil and gas leases in Alaska's Arctic Refuge In an aggressive move that angered Republicans, the Biden administration canceled the seven remaining oil and gas leases in Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge on Wednesday, overturning sales held in the Trump administration's waning days, and proposed stronger protections against development on vast swaths of the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska.The Department of Interior's scrapping of the leases comes after the Biden administration disappointed environmental groups earlier this year by approving the Willow oil project in the petroleum reserve, a massive project by ConocoPhillips Alaska that could produce up to 180,000 barrels of oil a day on Alaska’s petroleum-rich North Slope. Protections are proposed for more than 20,000 square miles (51,800 square kilometers) of land in the reserve in the western Arctic. Some critics who said the approval of Willow flew in the face of Biden’s pledges to address climate change lauded Wednesday's announcement. But they said more could be done. Litigation over the approval of the Willow project is pending. ""Alaska is home to many of America’s most breathtaking natural wonders and culturally significant areas. As the climate crisis warms the Arctic more than twice as fast as the rest of the world, we have a responsibility to protect this treasured region for all ages,"" Biden said in a statement. His actions “meet the urgency of the climate crisis” and will “protect our lands and waters for generations to come,"" Biden said. Alaska's Republican governor condemned Biden's moves and threatened to sue. And at least one Democratic lawmaker said the decision could hurt Indigenous communities in an isolated region where oil development is an important economic driver. Interior Secretary Deb Haaland, who drew criticism for her role in the approval of the Willow project, said Wednesday that “no one will have rights to drill for oil in one of the most sensitive landscapes on earth.” However, a 2017 law mandates another lease sale by late 2024. Administration officials said they intend to comply with the law. The Biden administration also announced proposed rules aimed at providing stronger protections against new leasing and development in portions of the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska that are designated as special areas for their wildlife, subsistence, scenic or other values. The proposal still must go through public comment. Willow lies within the reserve but was not expected to be affected by the proposed rules. The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge’s 1.5-million-acre (600,000-hectare) coastal plain, which lies along the Beaufort Sea on Alaska’s northeastern edge, is seen as sacred by the Indigenous Gwich’in because it is where caribou they rely on migrate and come to give birth. The plain is marked by hills, rivers and small lakes and tundra. Migratory birds and caribou pass through the plain, which provides habitat for wildlife including polar bears and wolves. Alaska political leaders — including some Democrats — have long pushed to allow oil and gas drilling in the refuge in part because of its economic impact on Indigenous communities in an area with few other jobs. Many of those same voices pressed Biden to approve the Willow project for the same reason. “I am deeply frustrated by the reversal of these leases in ANWR,” said U.S. Rep. Mary Peltola, a Democrat, using a common shorthand for the refuge. “This administration showed that it is capable of listening to Alaskans with the approval of the Willow Project, and it is some of those same Inupiat North Slope communities who are most impacted by this decision. I will continue to advocate for them and for Alaska’s ability to explore and develop our natural resources."" Alaska’s congressional delegation in 2017 succeeded in getting language added to a federal tax law that called for the U.S. government to hold two lease sales in the region by late 2024. Drilling opponents on Wednesday urged Congress to repeal the leasing provision from the 2017 law and permanently make the coastal plain off limits to drilling.“It is nearly impossible to overstate the importance of today’s announcements for Arctic conservation,” said Jamie Williams, president of the Wilderness Society. “Once again, the Arctic Refuge is free of oil leases. Our climate is a bit safer and there is renewed hope for permanently protecting one of the last great wild landscapes in America.” Alaska Republican U.S. Sen. Dan Sullivan denounced Biden's actions as the latest volley in what he called a “war on Alaska.” Two other leases that were issued as part of the first-of-its-kind sale for the refuge in January 2021 were previously given up by the small companies that held them amid legal wrangling and uncertainty over the drilling program. After taking office, Biden issued an executive order calling for a temporary moratorium on activities related to the leasing program and for the Interior secretary to review the program. Haaland later in 2021 ordered a new environmental review after concluding there were “multiple legal deficiencies” underlying the Trump-era leasing program. Haaland halted activities related to the leasing program pending the new analysis. A draft environmental review was released Wednesday.The Alaska Industrial Development and Export Authority, a state corporation that won seven leases in the 2021 sale, sued over the moratorium. But a federal judge recently found the delay by Interior to conduct a new review was not unreasonable. The corporation obtained the leases to preserve drilling rights in case oil companies did not come forward. Major oil companies sat out the sale, held after prominent banks had announced they would not finance Arctic oil and gas projects.Bernadette Demientieff, executive director of the Gwich’in Steering Committee, thanked the administration for the lease cancellation — but issued a warning. “We know that our sacred land is only temporarily safe from oil and gas development,” she said. ""We urge the administration and our leaders in Congress to repeal the oil and gas program and permanently protect the Arctic Refuge.”",Liberal
Daily Progress,"This summer was a global record breaker for the highest heat ever measured GENEVA — Earth sweltered through its hottest Northern Hemisphere summer ever measured, with a record warm August capping a season of brutal and deadly temperatures, according to the United Nations' World Meteorological Organization. Last month was not only the hottest August scientists ever recorded by far with modern equipment, it was also the second hottest month measured, behind only July 2023, WMO and the European climate service Copernicus announced Wednesday. August was about 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit warmer than pre-industrial averages. That is the threshold that the world is trying not to pass, though scientists are more concerned about rises in temperatures over decades, not merely a blip over a month's time. The world's oceans — more than 70% of the Earth's surface — were the hottest ever recorded, nearly 69.8, and set high temperature marks for three consecutive months, the WMO and Copernicus said. ""The dog days of summer are not just barking, they are biting,"" United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said in a statement. ""Climate breakdown has begun."" So far, 2023 is the second hottest year on record, behind 2016, according to Copernicus. Scientists blame ever warming human-caused climate change from the burning of coal, oil and natural gas with an extra push from a natural El Nino — a temporary warming of parts of the Pacific Ocean that changes weather worldwide. Climatologist Andrew Weaver said the numbers announced by WMO and Copernicus come as no surprise, bemoaning how governments have not appeared to take the issue of global warming seriously enough. He expressed concern that the public will just forget the issue when temperatures fall again. ""It's time for global leaders to start telling the truth,"" said Weaver, a professor at the School of Earth and Ocean Sciences at the University of Victoria in Canada. ""We will not limit warming to 1.5 C; we will not limit warming to 2.0 C. It's all hands on deck now to prevent 3.0 C global warming — a level of warming that will wreak havoc worldwide."" Copernicus, a division of the European Union's space program, has records going back to 1940, but in the United Kingdom and the United States, global records go back to the mid 1800s and those weather and science agencies are expected to soon report that the summer was a record-breaker. ""What we are observing, not only new extremes but the persistence of these record-breaking conditions, and the impacts these have on both people and planet, are a clear consequence of the warming of the climate system,"" said Copernicus Climate Change Service Director Carlo Buontempo. Scientists have used tree rings, ice cores and other proxies to estimate that temperatures are now warmer than they have been in about 120,000 years. The world has been warmer before, but that was prior to human civilization, seas were much higher and the poles were not icy. So far, daily September temperatures are higher than what has been recorded before for this time of year, according to the University of Maine's Climate Reanalyzer. While the world's air and oceans set records for heat, Antarctica continued to set records for low amounts of sea ice, the WMO said.""Antarctic sea ice extent was literally off the charts, and the global sea surface temperature was once again at a new record,"" WMO's secretary-general, Petteri Taalas, said in a statement released to the media. ""It is worth noting that this is happening BEFORE we see the full warming impact of the El Nino event, which typically plays out in the second year after it develops."" A strong El Nino coincided with the all-time high temperatures in 2016. The U.N. weather agency this year rolled out predictions that suggest Earth would have a year that averages 1.5 degrees Celsius warmer than in the mid 19th century within the next five years. Each year at or near 1.5 matters. It also predicted 98% chance of breaking the 2016 record between now and 2027. The new readings on high global temperatures came as WMO released its latest bulletin on air quality and climate Wednesday, noting that extreme heat, compounded by wildfires and desert dust, has had a measurable impact on air quality, human health and the environment. WMO scientific adviser Lorenzo Labrador lamented the deteriorating air quality around the globe and cited ""record-breaking wildfire season"" in many parts of the world, including western Canada and Europe. ""If heat waves increase as a result of El Nino, we may probably expect a further degradation in air quality as a whole,"" he said.",Liberal
Daily Progress,"The first Africa Climate Summit opens as hard-hit continent of 1.3B demands more say and financing The first African Climate Summit is opening with heads of state and others asserting a stronger voice on a global issue that affects the continent of 1.3 billion people the most, even though they contribute to it the least NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) — The first African Climate Summit opened Monday with heads of state and others asserting a stronger voice on a worldwide issue that affects their continent the most even though its 1.3 billion people contribute to global warming the least. Kenyan President William Ruto’s government and the African Union launched a ministerial session as more than a dozen heads of state began to arrive, determined to wield more global influence and bring in far more financing and support. The first speakers included young people, who demanded a bigger voice in the process. “For a very long time we have looked at this as a problem. There are immense opportunities as well,” Ruto said of the climate crisis, speaking of multibillion-dollar economic possibilities, new financial structures, Africa's huge mineral wealth and the ideal of shared prosperity. “We are not here to catalog grievances,” he said. And yet there is some frustration on the continent about being asked to develop in cleaner ways than the world's richest countries — which have long produced most of the emissions that endanger climate — and to do it while much of the support that has been pledged hasn't appeared. “This is our time,” Mithika Mwenda of the Pan African Climate Justice Alliance told the gathering, claiming that the annual flow of climate assistance to the continent is a tenth or less of what is needed and a “fraction” of the budget of some polluting companies. “We need to immediately see the delivery of the $100 billion"" of climate finance pledged annually by rich countries to developing ones, said Simon Stiell, executive secretary of the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change. More than $83 billion in climate financing was given to poorer countries in 2020, a 4% increase from the previous year but still short of the goal set in 2009. Kenya alone needs $62 billion to implement its plan to reduce national emissions that contribute to global warming, the president said. “We have an abundance of clean, renewable energy and it’s vital that we use this to power our future prosperity. But to unlock it, Africa needs funding from countries that have got rich off our suffering,” Mohamed Adow of Power Shift Africa said ahead of the summit. Outside attendees to the summit include the U.S. government’s climate envoy, John Kerry, and United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, who has said he will address finance as one of “the burning injustices of the climate crisis.” “Of 20 countries most affected by the climate crisis, 17 are here in Africa,” Kerry said. As Kenya's president spoke, hundreds of people joined a “people's march” on climate in Nairobi, holding signs demanding the targeting of fossil fuels. “Stop the neo-colonial scramble for oil and gas in Africa,"" one read. Ruto in the past has said the “addiction” to fossil fuels must end. One project being protested is the TotalEnergies-funded 897-mile (1,443-kilometer) East Africa Crude Oil Pipeline in Uganda and Tanzania. “We know that fossil fuel companies have lots of subsidies,” so more subsidies for solar power are needed to massively scale up renewable sources, said Ugandan activist Vanessa Nakate. The U.N. has estimated that loss and damage in Africa due to climate change are projected to be between $290 billion and $440 billion in the period from 2020 to 2030, depending on the degree of warming. Ruto’s video welcome released before the summit was heavy on tree-planting but didn’t mention his administration’s decision this year to lift a yearslong ban on commercial logging, which alarmed environmental watchdogs. The decision has been challenged in court, while the government says only mature trees in state-run plantations would be harvested. “When a country is holding a conference like we are, we should be leading by example,” said Isaac Kalua, a local environmentalist. Kenya derives 93% of its power from renewables and has banned single-use plastic bags, but it struggles with some other climate-friendly adaptations. Trees were chopped down to make way for the expressway that some summit attendees used to travel from the airport, and bags of charcoal made from local trees, mostly in small kilns, are found on some Nairobi street corners. Ruto made his way to Monday’s events in a small electric car, a contrast to the usual government convoys, on streets cleared of the sometimes poorly maintained buses and vans belching smoke. Elsewhere, nearly 600 million Africans lack access to electricity despite the vast potential for solar and other renewable power. Other challenges for the African continent include simply being able to forecast and monitor the weather in order to avert thousands of deaths and billions of dollars in damages that, like climate change itself, have effects far beyond the continent. “When the apocalypse happens, it will happen for all of us,” Ruto warned.",Liberal
Daily Progress,"Maine's puffin colonies recovering in the face of climate change EASTERN EGG ROCK, Maine — On remote islands off the Maine coast, a unique bird held its own this year in the face of climate change. Atlantic puffins — clownish seabirds with colorful bills and waddling gaits — had their second consecutive rebound year for fledging chicks after suffering a catastrophic 2021, said scientists who monitor the birds. The news flies in the face of environmental trends, as scientists have said warming waters off New England jeopardize the birds because that reduces the kind of fish they need to feed their chicks. One fish, though — the sand lance — has remained in abundance this year, allowing puffins to thrive, said Don Lyons, director of conservation science at National Audubon Society’s Seabird Institute in Bremen, Maine. He said it’s a sign the impact of climate change on ecosystems is not always as tidy as we think. The encouraging news comes as the Audubon Society is celebrating its 50th anniversary of tending to Maine's puffin colonies, which it restored from just a few dozen pairs. There are now as many as 3,000 birds, and the population is stable, Lyons said. “This year is a good example of how complex things are. We can't boil it down to one variable,” he said. “We still have a lot to learn.” The puffins — also known as “clowns of the sea” or “sea parrots” — nest in burrows and feed their chicks small fish such as herring. Two years ago, the colonies suffered one of their worst years for reproduction in decades due to a lack of those fish. Only about a quarter of the birds were able to raise chicks that summer. Audubon and other conservation groups have tied the fish shortage to warming ocean temperatures. The Gulf of Maine, which has puffin colonies on its islands, is warming faster than most of the world's oceans, and some recent years have been especially warm. The early part of this summer appears to have been “still unusually warm,” said David Reidmiller, climate center director at Gulf of Maine Research Institute in Portland, Maine. About two-thirds of the puffins fledged chicks last year, Lyons said. The birds did not equal that number this year, he said, but they again had a better year than 2021 despite a less than ideal summer of hot, rainy conditions. The puffins' ability to reproduce despite environmental changes speaks to the resiliency of seabirds, said Bill Sydeman, president and chief scientist of the Farallon Institute, a marine preservation organization based in California. However, the long-term dangers posed by climate change — such as fatal heat waves, loss of food, loss of islands to sea level rise and inability to breed — remain existential threats to puffins and many other seabirds, he said.“The problem with climate change is these breeding failures and low breeding productivity years are now becoming chronic,” Sydeman said. “There will be fewer young birds in the population that are able to recruit into the breeding population.” Maine's puffins are the only breeding Atlantic puffins in the U.S. Worldwide, the species lives in the North Atlantic from Maine and Canada to Europe. Other countries with large puffin populations, such as Iceland, have seen the birds decline in number in recent decades.The Maine puffin population once dwindled to only about 70 pairs on tiny Matinicus Rock. Hunters who pursued the birds for their meat and feathers had nearly wiped them out by the early 1900s. Stephen Kress, an Audubon ornithologist, sought to grow puffin colonies starting in the 1970s by relocating chicks from Canada to Eastern Egg Rock, another tiny island. Today, puffins live on Matinicus as well as Eastern Egg Rock, Seal Island and Petit Manan Island. On a recent trip to Eastern Egg Rock, located off St. George, dozens of puffins delighted tour boats as they took off in flight and dove into the water in pursuit of fish.The adult birds in the colonies appear fairly robust, and it's ""likely the population is stable, and it could still be growing,” Lyons said. The effects of climate change on seabirds have been a focus of scientific inquiry in recent years. Interest in the subject has accelerated because of die-offs of some of the puffin's auk family relatives, such as common murres and Cassin's auklets off the West Coast. The challenges faced by seabirds make successful breeding seasons especially important, said P. Dee Boersma, a University of Washington professor of biology and director of the university's Center for Ecosystem Sentinels.“What that means is we should be more cautious and concerned about reproductive failures and things like that to make sure that in good years everyone that wants to has a chance to breed, and do well,” Boersma said.",Liberal
Daily Progress,"Native nations on front lines of climate change share knowledge and find support at intensive camps PORT ANGELES, Wash. — Jeanette Kiokun, the tribal clerk for the Qutekcak Native Tribe in Alaska, doesn't immediately recognize the shriveled, brown plant she finds on the shore of the Salish Sea or others that were sunburned during the long, hot summer. But a fellow student at a weeklong tribal climate camp does. They are rosehips, traditionally used in teas and baths by the Skokomish Indian Tribe in Washington state and other tribes. “It’s getting too hot, too quick,” Alisa Smith Woodruff, a member of the Skokomish tribe, said of the sun-damaged plant. Tribes suffer some of the most severe impacts of climate change in the U.S. but often have the fewest resources to respond, which makes the intensive camps on combating the impact of climate change a vital training ground and community-building space. People from at least 28 tribes and intertribal organizations attended this year’s camp in August in Port Angeles, Washington, and more than 70 tribes have taken part in similar camps organized by the Affiliated Tribes of Northwest Indians across the U.S. since 2016. They heard from tribal leaders and scientists and learned about a clam garden that is combating ocean acidification. They visited the Elwha River, where salmon runs were recently restored after the Lower Elwha Klallam Tribe fought to have two dams torn down. They also learned how to make the most of newly available federal funds to add climate staff, restore habitats and reduce carbon emissions. And they set aside time to focus on cultural practices, such as cedar weaving, to unwind from the harsh realities of climate change.“(What) this camp has done for us is to help us know that there is the network, there is a supporting web out there, that we can help one another,"" said Jonny Bearcub Stiffarm, a member of the climate advisory board for the Fort Peck Assiniboine and Sioux Tribes in Montana. ""So we make new songs. We make new stories. We make new visions that we embrace for the positive outcome of our people. We make new warrior societies, new climate warrior societies.” Knowledge-sharing between tribes is not new. There were trade routes across North America before colonization. During first contact, tribes on the East Coast would send runners as far west as possible to share the news, said Amelia Marchand, citizen of the Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation. “This is kind of like a revitalization and an extension of that,” she said. Kiokun is one of only three full-time employees for the Qutekcak Native Tribe. In 2022, a landslide cut off a major road and hurled debris into a bay, damaging a popular fishing spot for tribal elders, said Jami Fenn, the tribe’s financial grant manager. Out of last year's camp came a group made up of tribes and Native villages across the Chugach region in Alaska, including the Qutekcak Native Tribe, focused on responding to climate change. The group is now working to get a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration grant so they can rebuild fish habitats ruined by the landslides and add liaisons with federal entities on climate change issues. Camp participants include those first starting to consider actions to counter the effects of climate change to those who have long had plans in place. The Jamestown S’Klallam Tribe in Washington attended for the first time last year. Soon after, they added a staff member focused on climate change, installed their first solar panels, and kicked off a friendly competition with the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation to see which could become carbon neutral by 2032. This year, the tribe co-hosted the camp. Loni Greninger, Jamestown S’Klallam Tribe vice chair, said a comment from a participant last year had stuck with her, about how the Western red cedar — which is central to the tribe's cultural identity — could die off in the Pacific Northwest because of excessive heat due to climate change.“To think about a world where there wouldn’t be cedar anymore, where I can’t smell it, where I can’t touch it, where I can’t work with it, where I can’t weave with it, where I can’t use it anymore. That caught my attention,” she said. “I don’t want to be in a world like that.” This year’s camp had added urgency. The federal government has granted more than $720 million through the Inflation Reduction Act to help tribes plan and adapt to climate change. But Marchand, from the Affiliated Tribes of Northwest Indians, said navigating these opportunities can be “overwhelming” for tribal staff juggling many responsibilities.The training helps tribes see “what the low-hanging fruit is where they can leverage their energy,"" she said. Near the end of the camp, each tribal team presented projects they were working on and discussed the impact of climate change. The Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes in Montana was among the first tribes in the U.S. to develop a climate response plan, and the tribe's climate change advisory committee chairman willingly shared that with other camp attendees.“You don’t have to steal it, it’s yours,"" Michael Durglo Jr. told the group. “Everything I have is yours.”The Qutekcak Native Tribe is planning a tribal youth climate camp in Alaska, and Durglo has already agreed to teach part of the six-week program.Kiokun, the tribe's tribal clerk, also plans to help with this work.“I think I’ve found a new passion,"" she said.",Liberal
Daily Progress,"Study reveals how much carbon damage would cost corporations if they paid for their emissions The world’s corporations produce so much climate change pollution, it could eat up about 44% of their profits if they had to pay damages for it, according to a study by economists of nearly 15,000 public companies.The “corporate carbon damages” from those publicly owned companies analyzed — a fraction of all the corporations — probably runs in the trillions of dollars globally and in the hundreds of billions for American firms, one of the study authors estimated in figures that were not part of the published research. That's based on the cost of carbon dioxide pollution that the U.S. government has proposed. Nearly 90% of that calculated damage comes from four industries: energy, utilities, transportation and manufacturing of materials such as steel. The study in the journal Science, released last week by a team of economists and finance professors, looks at what new government efforts to get companies to report their emissions of heat-trapping gases would mean, both to the firm’s bottom lines and the world’s ecological health. Earlier this year, the European Union enacted rules that would eventually require firms to disclose carbon emissions and the United States Securities and Exchange Commission and the state of California are looking at similar regulations.Study co-author Christian Leuz, a finance and accounting professor at the University of Chicago, said the idea “of shining the light on corporate activities that have costs to society is very powerful, but it is not enough to save the planet.” An earlier study of his found that after fracking firms disclosed their pollution rates, those contamination levels dropped 10% to 15%, he said.The idea is consumers and stockholders would see the damage and pressure firms to be cleaner, Leuz said. Outside economists agreed. Leuz and his colleagues used a private analysis firm that finds or estimates carbon emissions of some publicly owned companies and analyzed the carbon pollution from 14,879 firms. Then they compared them to company revenues and profits. That calculation shows “which activities are particularly costly to society from a climate perspective,” Leuz said. Still, he cautioned that “it would not be correct to just blame the companies. It is not possible to divide responsibility for these damages between the firms that make the products and consumers who buy them.” The calculations are for only a fraction of the world’s corporations, with many public companies not included and private firms not listed at all, Leuz said.The economists didn’t identify or tease out single companies but instead grouped firms by industry and by country. And they only used direct emissions, not what happens downstream. So the gas in a person's car does not count toward an oil company's emissions or corporate carbon damages.The calculations use the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s $190 cost per ton for carbon dioxide emissions and the study doesn't give a bottom line number in dollars, just in percent of profit and revenues. Only when asked by The Associated Press did Leuz estimate it in the trillions of dollars. At $190 a ton, the utility industry averaged damages more than twice its profits. Materials manufacturing, energy and transportation industries all had average damages that exceeded their profits. On the opposite end, the banking and insurance industries averaged climate damages that were less than 1% of their profits. When looking at companies based on countries, Russia and Indonesia were the top for corporate climate damages, while the United Kingdom and the United States were the lowest. Leuz said that reflects the age and efficiency of the companies and which type of industries were based in countries. Several outside experts said the study made sense within certain limits, while a few found faults with some of the choices of what to count, saying not counting downstream emissions is a problem. Because it doesn’t count those it “does not provide an incentive to reduce these to the level needed,” said Bill Hare, CEO of Climate Analytics, which studies global emissions and reduction efforts. “The results are important but perhaps not that surprising,” Stanford University economist Marshall Burke said. “The bigger take-home is the number of caveats that are needed to do this analysis, indicating what a mess our emissions accounting systems currently are.”Appalachian State University’s Gregg Marland, who helps track global emissions by country, said “good numbers do allow us to know who is producing the products that consumers want with the least contribution to climate change.” Nobel Prize-winning economist Paul Romer, formerly of the World Bank and now at Boston College, said the damage estimates are useful but need to be interpreted accurately, “without the moralistic framing and induced urge to punish.” Romer used the example of his move from New York to Boston. The initial move would go under the moving company’s corporate carbon damage, but when he took some books from his home they would not. Misusing corporate carbon damage figures could put the moving company out of business and he’d drive his stuff instead, so total carbon emissions would not be changed. Shifting to zero carbon fuel makes more sense, he said. ",Liberal
Daily Progress,"Climate activists target jets, yachts and golf in a string of global protests against luxury BARCELONA, Spain — Climate activists have spraypainted a superyacht, blocked private jets from taking off and plugged holes in golf courses this summer as part of an intensifying campaign against the emissions-spewing lifestyles of the ultrawealthy. Climate activism has intensified in the past few years as the planet warms to dangerous levels, igniting more extreme heat, floods, storms and wildfires around the world. Tactics have been getting more radical, with some protesters gluing themselves to roads, disrupting high-profile sporting events like golf and tennis and even splashing famous pieces of artwork with paint or soup. They’re now turning their attention to the wealthy, after long targeting some of the world’s most profitable companies – oil and gas conglomerates, banks and insurance firms that continue to invest in fossil fuels. “We do not point the finger at the people but at their lifestyle, the injustice it represents,” said Karen Killeen, an Extinction Rebellion activist who was involved in protests in Ibiza, Spain, a favorite summer spot for the wealthy. She said the group is protesting unnecessary emissions such as superrich individuals going to pick up a pizza by boat. “In a climate emergency, it’s an atrocity,” she said. Killeen and others from climate activist group Futuro Vegetal — or Vegetable Future — spraypainted a $300 million superyacht belonging to Walmart heir Nancy Walton Laurie. Protesters held up a sign that read, “You consume, others suffer.” In Switzerland, some 100 activists disrupted Europe’s biggest private jet sales fair in Geneva when they chained themselves to aircraft gangways and the exhibition entrance. In Germany, climate group Letzte Generation — which translates to Last Generation — spraypainted a private jet in the resort island of Sylt, in the North Sea. In Spain, activists plugged holes in golf courses to protest the sport's heavy water needs during hot dry spells. In the U.S., Abigail Disney, the grand-niece of Walt Disney, was arrested at East Hampton Town Airport, New York, in July along with 13 other protesters for blocking cars from entering or exiting the parking lot. It was the first of up to eight actions carried out in the exclusive Hamptons area. Activists also crashed a golf course, disrupted a museum gala and demonstrated outside some private luxury homes. “Luxury practices are disproportionately contributing to the climate crisis at this point,” said American University social scientist Dana Fisher. According to a 2021 report by nonprofit Oxfam, if all planet-warming emissions were attributed to the people producing them, the richest 1% will be responsible for around 16% of emissions by 2030. “It makes a lot of sense for these activists to be calling out this toxic behavior.” Richard Wilk, an economic anthropologist at Indiana University, said luxury travel is “the real culprit” in the emissions of the ultrawealthy. He published estimates of top billionaires’ annual emissions in 2021 and found that a superyacht — with permanent crew, helicopter pad, submarines and pools — emits about 7,020 tons of carbon dioxide a year, over 1,500 times higher than a typical family car. And private aircraft in Europe alone last year caused more than 3 million tons of carbon pollution, equivalent to the average annual CO2 emissions of over half a million EU residents, according to the nonprofit Greenpeace. But University of Pennsylvania climate scientist Michael Mann warned that attention away from the fossil fuel companies — which are responsible for at least 70% of all emissions — and toward the rich could be “playing right into the hands of the fossil fuel industry and the ‘deflection campaign’ they’ve used to divert attention from regulation by emphasizing individual carbon footprints over the much larger footprint of polluters.” “The solution is to get everyone to use less carbon-based energy,” whether wealthy or lower-income people, he said. David Gitman, president of Monarch Air Group, a Florida private air charter provider, encouraged activists to think twice about whether they're taking the right approach. “If their activism goes toward some sort of actual assistance to real programs to make real change like sustainable aviation fuel, like carbon offsets, I think that this kind of activism can help achieve those results,” said Gitman. “Now, if they go out and they spray-paint a private jet in an airport in Europe, is that going to get those results? In my opinion, no.” Fisher, of the University of Maryland, was also skeptical that the activism was effective in changing behavior by the wealthy. In some cases, governments have stepped in with regulations. France is cracking down on the use of private jets for short journeys, and earlier this year, the Netherlands' Schiphol Airport also announced plans to ban private jets. But as protests escalate, Fisher and Wilk say they could still move the needle toward behavior change.“Public shaming is one of the most powerful ways of controlling people,” Wilk said. “It acts in a lot of different ways to embarrass people, to make them more conscious of the consequences of their actions.”",Liberal
CNN,"Climate change is hurting Six Flags, SeaWorld and Disney World Over the weekend, intense rain and flooding stranded more than 70,000 people at Burning Man in the Nevada desert. It’s the latest example of how extreme weather, exacerbated by climate change, impacted major North American attractions this summer.The largest theme park companies — Six Flags (SIX), SeaWorld and Cedar Point-parent Cedar Fair — all were upended by extreme weather, including deadly flooding in the Northeast, record-breaking heat in the Southwest and California, and wildfires in Canada. Extreme heat in Florida also disrupted attendance at Walt Disney World and Universal Orlando this summer. These attractions are dependent on weather and climate change poses significant risks to their businesses. Theme parks are building indoor rides and changing ticket policies to respond to brutal weather conditions.“Weather was the clear driver of weakness in the period across regional theme parks,” Paul Golding, an analyst at Macquarie Research, said in a note to clients. Golding has lowered his estimates for the theme park industry because of growing risks from extreme weather. Cedar Fair (FUN), which also owns Canada’s Wonderland in Ontario and Knott’s Berry Farm in California, said that Canadian wildfires and extreme heat in California impacted attendance by 300,000 visits during its latest quarter. “Attendance isn’t just driven by the weather in the moment,” but the weather when customers buy tickets months in advance, Brian Witherow, Cedar Fair’s chief financial officer, said on an earnings call last month. SeaWorld (SEAS) attendance fell 2% last quarter from the same time a year prior as fewer people visited its outdoor water parks. The decline was “primarily due to significantly adverse weather,” including rainfall and the fallout from Canadian wildfires, SeaWorld’s finance chief James Forrester said. The company has been hit hard by extreme weather in recent years that have caused park closures and attendance drops in Florida, Texas and Virginia. SeaWorld warns in its annual report to investors that extreme weather events could cause it to “incur significant costs.” “The series of extreme weather events experienced in recent years presents an alarming trend,” SeaWorld said. “Changing climate conditions could add to the frequency and severity of natural disasters and create additional uncertainty.” “For example, attendance at our parks in 2022 was negatively impacted by Hurricane Ian which led to closures at our parks in Florida and Virginia for a combined 15 operating days,” the annual report added. Meanwhile, Six Flags said its attendance growth fell short of its expectations because of unusually high rainfall in the Northeast and a record heat wave in the South. “When we have a good day versus a bad weather day, the attendance lift is notable,” Six Flags finance chief Gary Mick said on an earnings call last month. Six Flags is adding more shaded structures, water misters, splash zones and air-conditioned areas. As the weather “continues to be hotter every year,” Six Flags will build more indoor and air-conditioned rides and restaurants, Mick said. Premier Rides, a company that has built roller coasters for Six Flags and other amusement parks, is using more steel in designs to make them last longer in hotter and more extreme conditions, according to the Wall Street Journal. Theme parks are also beginning to change their policies to offer free return tickets when temperatures hit extreme levels, a sign that parks believe heat waves could hurt attendance in the future. SeaWorld last month expanded its weather guarantee policy to cover heat indexes above 110.",Liberal
CNN,"Extreme heat, fires and floods threaten Europe’s economy London CNN Mounting climate risks, illustrated by the extreme heat, wildfires and floods that ravaged parts of Europe this summer, could hurt the region’s economy as soon as this year, the European Commission warned Monday. In its latest economic forecast, the European Union’s executive arm downgraded its predictions for growth in the region in 2023 and 2024. But even that gloomier outlook could prove too optimistic, it said.“The materialization of these [climate] risks bears severe costs for the EU economy, in terms of losses in natural capital and deterioration of economic activity, including tourism,” the commission said. It now expects the EU’s gross domestic product to grow 0.8% this year, down from a 1% rise forecast in the spring. Next year’s growth has been revised to 1.4% from 1.7%. The commission blamed weak domestic demand, dampened by high inflation, as well as rising interest rates for the downgrades. But it added that there was “formidable uncertainty” over its latest forecast, with extreme weather among the “downside” risks. No Roman holiday? Tourism can account for as much as a fifth of annual GDP in some countries in the region. Europeans are already starting to rethink where to vacation in the future after this year’s scorching temperatures in southern Europe and the hottest summer ever recorded on the continent in 2022. The European Travel Commission, an association of tourism organizations, said in July that the number of European tourists planning to travel to Mediterranean destinations in the summer and fall this year had dropped 10% compared with the same period in 2022. Meanwhile, the Czech Republic, Bulgaria, Ireland and Denmark, where the weather is milder, had seen a “surge in popularity,” the ETC noted. Travelers from outside the EU may likewise lose their taste for vacations in Italy and Greece, both of which have been battling wildfires. A spokesperson at ForwardKeys, a travel data company, told CNN in July that “there has been a shift in preference towards cooler and more northern destinations” among UK travelers as a result of heat waves in continental Europe that month. Global warming could dent tourism in another way: by accelerating the erosion of beaches and amplifying wildfires that rip through forests — both part of Europe’s “natural capital,” David Owen, chief economist at Saltmarsh Economics, told CNN. In a study published last October, the Bank of Italy warned that rising temperatures risked stunting growth in the EU’s third-biggest economy, with tourism and agriculture most exposed. The blistering temperatures have already been bad news for olive trees, for a second year running, with industry experts warning of skyrocketing prices and potential shortages of olive oil. In Spain, the world’s biggest olive oil producer, production has already plunged. The full extent of the damage from this year’s heat won’t be known until after harvest time in October and November, but European olive oil production could sink by 700,000 metric tons — a fall of more than 30% — compared with its five-year average, according to Kyle Holland at market research group Mintec. Construction and manufacturing are among other economic sectors vulnerable to extreme heat, said Owen at Saltmarsh Economics.“If you’re having to learn to live with temperatures topping 40 degrees [Celsius] for a few days at a time in parts of southern Europe, we don’t function very well at those sorts of temperatures, so it will impact economies more generally,” he added. Similarly to the European Commission, on Sunday the International Monetary Fund pointed to “grave risks to economic well-being” from climate change. “G20 members must lead by example in delivering on the promises of $100 billion per year for climate finance,” IMF managing director Kristalina Georgieva said at the Group of 20 summit in India.“Countries also need to mobilize domestic resources to finance and manage the green transition through tax reforms, effective and efficient public spending, strong fiscal institutions, and deep local debt markets.”",Liberal
CNN,"Scientists say they’ve found a direct link between planet-warming pollution and polar bear survival Scientists say they have found a link between human-related greenhouse gas emissions and polar bear reproduction and survival rates for the first time in a new study, potentially overcoming a barrier to protecting the species.Polar bears live in 19 populations across the Arctic and are found in Canada, the United States, Russia, Greenland and Norway, according to conservation organization Polar Bears International. The populations live under distinct and varying circumstances, but all depend upon ice sheets to access their main prey, two species of seal, said study coauthor Steven Amstrup, chief scientist emeritus at Polar Bears International. When sea ice melts, polar bears are forced onto land where they are deprived of food and must survive on fat reserves that they have accumulated beforehand. Climate change caused by human activity is accelerating sea ice loss, giving polar bears less time to feed and build up their fat reserves, and more days where they are forced to go without food. This leads ultimately to a decline in their population. Researchers from Polar Bears International, the University of Washington and the University of Wyoming have quantified the connection between the number of ice-free days a population of polar bears has to endure and the amount of planet-warming pollution released into the atmosphere, as well as corresponding polar bear survival rates in some populations, according to the study published Thursday in the journal Science. Polar bears were listed as “threatened” due to human-caused climate warming under the US Endangered Species Act, or ESA, in 2008. But the US Department of Interior said at the time that, because threat to a particular species couldn’t be directly linked to a specific source of greenhouse gases, federal agencies don’t have to consider emissions when approving projects. The researchers said the new study provides evidence of that direct link. Impact of emissions Researchers looked at polar bear subpopulations that had experienced at least 10 years with ice-free seasons from 1979 — when satellite imagery of sea ice first became available — to 2020. They found that the number of days polar bears were forced to go without food increased as greenhouse gas emissions accumulated. For example, polar bears in the Chukchi Sea in the Arctic Ocean were forced to go without food for about 12 days in 1979. It increased to about 137 days in 2020, with another day of fasting being added for every 14 gigatons of greenhouse gas emissions released into the atmosphere. Subpopulations in areas where ice sheets would typically melt entirely during the summer — such as in Hudson Bay — saw slower increases in the days they were forced to go without food over time, compared with subpopulations in areas where ice sheets would usually remain during the summer, such as in the South Beaufort Sea. Bears in areas where ice sheets used to persist for longer in the summer are now experiencing “a sudden shift” in their environment, requiring a significant adjustment where they are having forced fast days that they did not have before, Amstrup told CNN. A 2020 study that Amstrup was involved in found that the number of days a bear can survive without food varies by region and the condition of the animal, but the more ice-free days experienced, the steeper the decline in reproduction and survival. The researchers behind the new study combined the relationship they found between the number of forced fast days polar bears had to endure and cumulative greenhouse gas emissions with the connection found in 2020 between the number of forced fast days and declining survival rates. That allowed them to calculate the impact of cumulative emissions on the rate of polar bear survival. “When the (Department of the Interior) memo was written in 2008, we could not say how greenhouse gas emissions equated to a decline in polar bear populations. But within a few years we could directly relate the quantity of emissions to climate warming and later to Arctic sea ice loss as well,” said study coauthor Cecilia Bitz, professor of atmospheric sciences at the University of Washington, in the news release. “Our study shows that not only sea ice, but polar bear survival, can be directly related to greenhouse gas emissions.” For example, the study noted that each of the hundreds of power plants in the US might make a relatively small contribution to emissions, but collectively the power plants emit nearly 2 gigatons of greenhouse gases each year. This would be about 60-plus gigatons over the 30-plus year life span of a polar bear in the southern Beaufort Sea. In this subpopulation, bears endure an extra forced fasting day for every 23 gigatons of emissions added to the atmosphere, so their survival rate would be reduced by about 4% by the power plant emissions over that period, according to the study. The US Department of the Interior declined to comment on the findings. Applications for other species Kirsten Zickfeld, distinguished professor of climate science at Simon Fraser University in Canada, said the new research shows a shift in what’s possible when it comes to demonstrating the effects of climate change. “Previous research showed that the more carbon dioxide we produce from human activities, the more our climate changes. The new study by Amstrup and Bitz takes this idea further by showing that this direct link also applies to ecosystem impacts,” said Zickfeld, who was not involved in the study. “They found that when we emit more carbon dioxide, it directly affects how many polar bear cubs can survive. This finding allows us to connect the decline in polar bear populations to individual sources of carbon emissions.” Amstrup said he hopes the study can be used as a template by other researchers to get other species affected by human-caused climate change protected by the ESA.",Liberal
Fox News,"Biden axes nominee overseeing home appliance crackdown after Joe Manchin's opposition. The White House abruptly withdrew its pick to oversee energy efficiency regulations, including those targeting natural gas-powered stoves, after Sen. Joe Manchin's, D-W.Va., opposition. In an unexpected announcement, the White House said it had pulled Jeff Marootian's name from consideration to lead the Department of Energy's (DOE) Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), which crafts appliance regulations and standards. Marootian's nomination was jeopardized after Manchin canceled an Energy and Natural Resources Committee vote to advance the nomination to a full floor vote in May. ""While I supported Mr. Marootian’s nomination in December, since then the office he’s been nominated to lead has proposed stove efficiency rules that I’ve raised concerns about,"" Manchin told Fox News Digital in a statement at the time. ""While I appreciate that these rules would only apply to new stoves, my view is that it’s part of a broader, administration-wide effort to eliminate fossil fuels,"" he continued. ""For that reason, I’m not comfortable moving forward with Mr. Marootian at this time."" Following Manchin's comments, the White House hit back at the West Virginia Democrat, saying it stood by all of its nominees. ""The president stands by his well-qualified nominees to do the important work of DOE,"" a White House official told Fox News Digital on May 18. Marootian was first nominated to take the helm at the EERE office in July 2022 after serving as special assistant to President Biden and, prior to that role, director of the Washington, D.C., Department of Transportation. The position has been vacant since Daniel Simmons, who led the office throughout the Trump administration, departed the DOE in early 2021. DOE Secretary Jennifer Granholm then hired Marootian as her senior adviser for energy efficiency and renewable energy in September. His confirmation hearing before the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee took place in November, and he was reported out of committee in December, but his nomination stalled at the end of session, forcing Biden to renominate him in January. Granholm said last year that Marootian would be a ""natural fit to lead the Department’s largest applied energy office"" and help the administration meet its ""bold clean energy goals."" Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee Ranking Member John Barrasso, R-Wyo., though, opposed the nomination, saying Marootian was more qualified for a Transportation Department role. Since Marootian was hired to advise Granholm on energy efficiency and since his nomination was returned to the White House, the DOE has pursued a number of energy efficiency regulations impacting many household appliances including gas stovetops, which many consumer advocates criticized as regulatory overreach. ""It's just spreading to more and more appliances. It seems that almost everything that plugs in or fires up around the house is either subject to a pending regulation or soon will be,"" Ben Lieberman, a senior fellow at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, previously told Fox News Digital. ""Consumers aren't going to like any of it,"" he added. ""These rules are almost always bad for consumers for the simple reason that they restrict consumer choice.""",Conservative
Fox News,"Biden admin quietly reverses Trump-era rule, bans transporting fossil fuels by train. Sen Ted Cruz says Biden admin action is 'another salvo in its war on American energy'. The Biden administration quietly rescinded a Trump-era regulation allowing companies to transport liquefied natural gas (LNG) via rail in a victory for environmental groups.In a federal filing Friday ahead of the holiday weekend, the Department of Transportation's Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) formally suspended the 2020 authorization of LNG transportation in rail tank cars. The rule will remain in effect until either a permanent rule regarding LNG rail tank car transportation is proposed and finalized — a process that may take several months — or June 30, 2025.""We are encouraged by the decision to suspend the dangerous practice of transporting highly flammable LNG by rail through communities,"" said Patrick Grenter, the director of eco group Sierra Club's Beyond Dirty Fuels Campaign.""We have seen the destruction that an accident can cause to communities bordering the railway route — often communities most impacted by pollution and we support any step that will keep it from happening again,"" he added. ""We urge PHMSA to make the only reasonable decision available to them: make the suspension permanent and ban LNG by rail once and for all.""The Sierra Club and several other environmental organizations, like Earthjustice, Natural Resources Defense Council and Food & Water Watch, have argued that allowing LNG transportation could lead to mass devastation. They have stated LNG is highly flammable and vulnerable to devastating explosions which could destroy communities which railroads cut through.Democratic lawmakers, led by Rep. Chrissy Houlahan, D-Pa., wrote to Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg earlier this year asking for a permanent ban on LNG transportation via rail and pointed to safety risks cited by environmental groups.According to PHMSA, the rulemaking helps the federal government avoid potential risks to public health and environmental consequences, including ""direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions."" The agency stated the rule also provides sufficient time to complete ongoing testing and evaluation efforts regarding LNG rail transportation and allows development of mitigation measures for such transportation.""Advancing rail safety measures that are based on the best available science and testing is crucial to keeping communities safe,"" PHMSA Deputy Administrator Tristan Brown told Fox News Digital in a statement.""This suspension will give time for PHMSA, in conjunction with the National Academies of Sciences and Engineering as well as its Canadian regulator counterparts, to complete critical research on transporting cryogenic liquids like LNG (and hydrogen) by rail more safely,"" Brown added. ""This research is expected to conclude in the next year or so and will inform future federal safety regulations from PHMSA and the FRA."" In June 2020, the Trump administration announced it had finalized the rule green-lighting the rail shipment of LNG. Former Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao said the agency had put new safeguards in place to prevent dangerous accidents. Shortly after the rule was implemented, a coalition of environmental groups and Democratic-led states sued PHMSA over the rule.However, the 2020 rule was supported by Republican lawmakers and states, and the rail industry, which said it was committed to freight rail transportation safety.""The extended hold of the rule for transporting LNG by rail is disappointing,"" Railway Supply Institute President Patty Long said Friday. ""Transporting LNG has a proven safety record, and with our country continuing to face rising energy prices, we should be incentivizing critical infrastructure that can provide additional capacity to the U.S."" ""We should not have to rely on foreign sources of LNG to meet demand in certain parts of the country,"" she continued. Long also penned a letter to PHMSA in late 2021 in response to a proposal to suspend the LNG rail rule, similarly arguing industry was prepared to safely transport the fossil fuel. Daniel Schmitt, senior counsel for major freight company CSX, warned at the time that suspension of the 2020 regulations would impose significant cost burdens on the company and could inadvertently impose safety and environmental risks.Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, the ranking member of the Senate Commerce Committee, said the action late last week was the latest ""salvo"" in the Biden administration's war on energy. ""Today, the Biden administration has fired another salvo in its war on American energy by essentially prohibiting the movement of LNG by rail,"" Cruz said. ""America is a leader in reducing carbon emissions largely because the of the United States' development and use of natural gas. The energy renaissance we are seeing in this country is producing enormous environmental benefits."" ""LNG by rail would give Americans — particularly those who have limited energy choices because of geography — an affordable and environmentally-responsible option to meet their energy needs,"" the Texas Republican added. ""By removing this option, the radical environmentalists in the Biden administration have delivered a further setback to American prosperity and national security."" ""This is yet another example of why the Biden administration cannot be trusted to implement pro-domestic energy policies.""",Conservative
Fox News,"Biden's FEMA director says extreme weather 'new normal' after Hawaii county blames fires on power line. Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Administrator Deanne Criswell suggested Tuesday that recent storms, including the devastating fires in Hawaii, were caused by climate change. During a White House briefing Tuesday afternoon, Criswell said extreme storms were part of a ""new normal"" Americans face after a reporter asked her whether such storms are out of the norm and whether there have been ""more intense events than before."" The FEMA administrator added the nation should invest in mitigation and resilience measures to combat future storms. ""What I can say is that we don't have a typical operational season like we've had in the past,"" Criswell remarked. ""We would normally prepare our staff to be extra alert during the peak of hurricane season, which is where we find ourselves right now. But our operational tempo has been year round. We started with atmospheric rivers in California in January, extreme tornadoes in the spring to the wildfires. ""Now, we are in peak hurricane season, and we have had an unprecedented number of disaster requests from governors because of the extreme weather that they're experiencing. ""This is our new normal. This is the operational tempo that we find ourselves in. We have to continue to invest in mitigation and resilience to help these communities reduce the impact from these storms."" Democratic lawmakers and climate activists have similarly argued that recent deadly storms have been triggered by man-made global warming. They have called for policies to curb carbon emissions by massively reducing reliance on fossil fuels and for President Biden to declare a climate emergency. Sen. Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., said the Hawaii fires proved ""climate chaos wreaking havoc on ecosystems everywhere is the new norm,"" and Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., warned the fires were a ""devastating view of our planet as we fail to adequately address the climate crisis."" In a lawsuit filed Thursday, the government of Maui County, Hawaii, alleged Hawaiian Electric Company (HECO) and its subsidiaries failed to properly power down live electrical equipment amid a red flag windstorm earlier this month. As a result, the suit adds, downed power lines sparked a series of fires on the island, leading to more than a hundred deaths and mass devastation. ""The lawsuit alleges that the Defendants acted negligently by failing to power down their electrical equipment despite a National Weather Service Red Flag Warning on August 7th,"" Maui County said in a release announcing its lawsuit. ""The lawsuit further alleges HECO’s energized and downed power lines ignited dry fuel such as grass and brush, causing the fires,"" the announcement added. ""The lawsuit also alleges failure to maintain the system and power grid, which caused the systemic failures starting three different fires on August 8th."" The county further stated in its lawsuit that HECO has a duty ""to properly maintain and repair the electric transmission lines, and other equipment including utility poles associated with their transmission of electricity, and to keep vegetation properly trimmed and maintained so as to prevent contact with overhead power lines and other electric equipment."" In response to the lawsuit, HECO pushed back on allegations its power lines caused the fires. The company said it de-energized power lines in western Maui, where much of the damage occurred Aug. 8. ""We were surprised and disappointed that the County of Maui rushed to court even before completing its own investigation,"" Shelee Kimura, the president and CEO of Hawaiian Electric, said in a statement Sunday. ""We believe the complaint is factually and legally irresponsible. It is inconsistent with the path that we believe we should pursue as a resilient community committed and accountable to each other as well as to Hawaii's future."" In addition, experts have thrown cold water on claims that climate change triggered the Maui fires even before the lawsuit. Instead, they said the event was largely a result of years of poor forest and brush management, in addition to declining agriculture. Such conditions, they said, allow fires to spread rapidly and make fires harder to contain. ""Blaming this on weather and climate is misleading,"" said Clay Trauernicht, a University of Hawaii at Manoa professor and environmental management expert. ""Hawaii's fire problem is due to the vast areas of unmanaged, nonnative grasslands from decades of declining agriculture."" ""These savannas now cover about a million acres across the main Hawaiian Islands, mostly the legacy of land clearing for plantation agriculture and ranching in the late 1800s/early 1900s,"" he added. ""The transformation to savanna makes the landscape way more sensitive to bad 'fire weather' — hot, dry, windy conditions. It also means we get huge buildups of fuels during rainy periods."" HECO didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.",Conservative
Fox News,"Puffin colonies in Maine recover, 'population is stable, and it could still be growing'. On remote islands off the Maine coast, a unique bird held its own this year in the face of climate change. Atlantic puffins — clownish seabirds with colorful bills and waddling gaits — had their second consecutive rebound year for fledging chicks after suffering a catastrophic 2021, said scientists who monitor the birds. The news flies in the face of environmental trends, as scientists have said warming waters off New England jeopardize the birds because that reduces the kind of fish they need to feed their chicks. One fish, though — the sand lance — has remained in abundance this year, allowing puffins to thrive, said Don Lyons, director of conservation science at National Audubon Society’s Seabird Institute in Bremen, Maine. He said it’s a sign the impact of climate change on ecosystems is not always as tidy as we think.The encouraging news comes as the Audubon Society is celebrating its 50th anniversary of tending to Maine's puffin colonies, which it restored from just a few dozen pairs. There are now as many as 3,000 birds, and the population is stable, Lyons said. ""This year is a good example of how complex things are. We can't boil it down to one variable,"" he said. ""We still have a lot to learn."" The puffins — also known as ""clowns of the sea"" or ""sea parrots"" — nest in burrows and feed their chicks small fish such as herring. Two years ago, the colonies suffered one of their worst years for reproduction in decades due to a lack of those fish. Only about a quarter of the birds were able to raise chicks that summer.Audubon and other conservation groups have tied the fish shortage to warming ocean temperatures. The Gulf of Maine, which has puffin colonies on its islands, is warming faster than most of the world's oceans, and some recent years have been especially warm. The early part of this summer appears to have been ""still unusually warm,"" said David Reidmiller, climate center director at Gulf of Maine Research Institute in Portland, Maine. About two-thirds of the puffins fledged chicks last year, Lyons said. The birds did not equal that number this year, he said, but they again had a better year than 2021 despite a less than ideal summer of hot, rainy conditions. The puffins' ability to reproduce despite environmental changes speaks to the resiliency of seabirds, said Bill Sydeman, president and chief scientist of the Farallon Institute, a marine preservation organization based in California. However, the long-term dangers posed by climate change — such as fatal heat waves, loss of food, loss of islands to sea level rise and inability to breed — remain existential threats to puffins and many other seabirds, he said.""The problem with climate change is these breeding failures and low breeding productivity years are now becoming chronic,"" Sydeman said. ""There will be fewer young birds in the population that are able to recruit into the breeding population."" Maine's puffins are the only breeding Atlantic puffins in the U.S. Worldwide, the species lives in the North Atlantic from Maine and Canada to Europe. Other countries with large puffin populations, such as Iceland, have seen the birds decline in number in recent decades. The Maine puffin population once dwindled to only about 70 pairs on tiny Matinicus Rock. Hunters who pursued the birds for their meat and feathers had nearly wiped them out by the early 1900s. Stephen Kress, an Audubon ornithologist, sought to grow puffin colonies starting in the 1970s by relocating chicks from Canada to Eastern Egg Rock, another tiny island. Today, puffins live on Matinicus as well as Eastern Egg Rock, Seal Island and Petit Manan Island. On a recent trip to Eastern Egg Rock, located off St. George, dozens of puffins delighted tour boats as they took off in flight and dove into the water in pursuit of fish.The adult birds in the colonies appear fairly robust, and it's ""likely the population is stable, and it could still be growing,"" Lyons said. The effects of climate change on seabirds have been a focus of scientific inquiry in recent years. Interest in the subject has accelerated because of die-offs of some of the puffin's auk family relatives, such ascommon murres and Cassin's auklets off the West Coast. The challenges faced by seabirds make successful breeding seasons especially important, said P. Dee Boersma, a University of Washington professor of biology and director of the university's Center for Ecosystem Sentinels. ""What that means is we should be more cautious and concerned about reproductive failures and things like that to make sure that in good years everyone that wants to has a chance to breed, and do well,"" Boersma said.",Conservative
Fox News,"Biden admin to fund $4M study linking climate change to child labor, trafficking in Nepal, grant docs show. The Biden administration is funding a $4 million project to determine a connection between child labor and climate change in the South Asian country of Nepal. The U.S. Department of Labor on Monday announced the availability of $4 million in federal taxpayer dollars to be released through its Bureau of International Labor Affairs (ILAB) ""to fund a technical assistance project in Nepal to increase the responsiveness of local communities to child labor and/or forced labor in the context of a changing climate."" Interested parities have until Oct. 9 to apply for the massive grant, and award decisions are expected to be announced by the end of December. One of the desired outcomes is ""increased understanding of the link between climate change and vulnerability to child labor and/or forced labor risks,"" while another is ""increased implementation of child-centered, gender-sensitive and socially inclusive climate adaptation initiatives,"" according to documents released on the federal government's grant website. The Labor Department said applicants must propose strategies ""based on a gender equity and social inclusion analysis to identify potential barriers of access to and control of resources and decision-making faced by men, women, boys and girls from diverse backgrounds and underrepresented populations, and how these barriers will be overcome by the project."" ""Locally-led"" climate change strategy, according to the grant details, should be collaborative with the Nepalese government to address the ""priorities of climate-vulnerable populations, such as children, women, indigenous populations, and other disadvantaged groups."" ""While further research is needed on the link between climate change and child labor and forced labor, there is evidence of climate change increasing vulnerability to labor exploitation and trafficking, gender-based violence and trafficking of women and girls, child labor, and forced labor and trafficking,"" the grant documents say. Rep. Mike Johnson, R-La., who sits on the House Judiciary Committee, is among critics who ripped the Biden administration for shelling out $4 million toward this study. ""The Biden administration’s priorities are simply absurd,"" Johnson told the Washington Examiner. ""While 5.8 million Americans are out of work, Biden’s DOL is spending money to investigate how 'a changing climate in Nepal' impacts child labor?!?"" ""This failed, woke approach to governance is destroying our country,"" he added. Fox News reached out to the Department of Labor for comment on the grant and the GOP criticism but they did not immediately respond. Kathleen Sgamma, president of Western Energy Alliance, an energy and public lands trade group with 200 member companies, told the Examiner the Biden administration is trying to use climate change as an ""explanation for everything"" instead of offering viable solutions to lift the Nepalese people from poverty. ""One way to do that is by helping them access more reliable, affordable energy in the form of oil, natural gas, and coal, which would actually reduce the poverty that causes families to have to rely on child labor,"" Sgamma said. ""A convoluted study about climate change does nothing to lift families out of poverty and free children to go to school instead of work in sweatshops."" In recent years, the number of children working in the brick kilns of Nepal has boomed after the 2015 earthquake and the COVID-19 pandemic, Getty reported. ""The real irony is that misguided climate change policies in the West that favor intermittent solar energy over reliable fossil fuels are actually directly leading to slave labor in China, where solar panels are made by enslaved Uyghurs,"" Sgamma added. Tax forms show Thea Lee, deputy undersecretary and leader of ILAB, which will distribute the grant funding, served as president of the progressive Economic Policy Institute think tank between 2018 and 2021 and has also sat on the board of the Congressional Progressive Caucus Center, the Examiner reported. The Labor Department said Nepal ranks 10th on the list of countries most at risk of climate change, according to the Global Climate Risk Index 2021. The World Bank estimates that 80% of Nepal’s population faces ""climate-related peril,"" according to the grant details. Nepal also has pernicious rates of child labor and forced labor, the Labor Department said, estimating 1.1 million children are in child labor, 222,493 of whom are in hazardous work and 85% are working in agriculture. Agriculture is a critical sector for Nepal, providing nearly one-third of its GDP.",Conservative
Fox News,"America's schools are becoming training grounds for climate change activists. Just when you thought we had made progress by exposing diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) and critical race theory (CRT)-infused curricula throughout our education system, we now have a new distraction: the climate change agenda. States like New Jersey, California, Connecticut, New York, and others, are advancing legislation to require climate change lessons in every K-12 subject – including foreign languages, math and physical education. This blatant attempt to cultivate an entire generation of Greta Thunbergs at a time when proficiency levels are abysmal should incite outrage among parents, teachers, and students. Just 29% of eighth graders are proficient in reading, 26% are proficient in math, 22% are proficient in civics, and a measly 13% are proficient in American history, according to the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP). While climate change deserves attention in science classes, other important subjects should not be used as a vehicle to push a political agenda. As the first state to integrate climate change standards across all subjects, New Jersey provides a glimpse into the climate curricula. According to the New Jersey Department of Education, all curricula must ""approach climate change and climate solutions from a climate justice perspective."" What this looks like in practice is an unabashed indoctrination effort. In foreign language courses, students will learn about ""global citizenry"" and the ""impact of climate change."" In math, teachers must actively incorporate climate change into word problems, charts and graphs. In social studies, students will learn about climate change, ""all for the purpose of planning/proposing advocacy projects to inform others about the impact of climate change."" New Jersey’s physical education standards reference climate change eight times, but never mention the danger of obesity. There are four standards related to climate change and only two regarding the importance of healthy eating habits. The indoctrination is evident in these new learning standards. Manipulating young minds inhibits academic growth and stifles skills such as critical analysis and problem-solving. Indoctrination restrains independent thought and pushes a one-sided perspective – but that is the point. At the same time that our public schools are indoctrinating the next generation to pledge allegiance to the climate change doctrine, the Biden administration and its allies are pushing misguided climate policies that kill jobs, waste taxpayer money, drive up prices, and artificially manipulate our economy. Our youngest minds are being trained to serve as activists for Big Government power grabs. Furthermore, infusing climate change into every subject shortchanges our children from the quality education they deserve. Each subject is important in shaping well-rounded, informed students. When these subjects are treated as mere vehicles to push a political agenda, students receive only diluted versions of the foundational skills of each subject area. For example, when foreign languages are manipulated to promote climate agendas, linguistic proficiency is overshadowed. Physical education promotes health and active lifestyles, but when climate change eclipses topics like obesity prevention, it undermines vital health education. Math is essential for logical reasoning and problem-solving. Social studies focuses on history and governance, which is necessary to cultivate an informed citizenry. Forcing climate change advocacy within social studies undermines the subject, especially when students possess limited knowledge about the fundamental principles and are unable to pass a basic citizenship exam. This push to codify climate change-infused subject matter in all subjects comes amid a stark decline in our education system, highlighted by historic lows in student performance. Climate change curricula shifts the focus away from the essential material that needs to be taught and serves as a distraction to divert our attention away from our failing schools. It is an attempt to create activists rather than foster critical thinkers capable of analyzing complex issues from multiple perspectives. It is time for parents, teachers and concerned citizens to reclaim our education system from those who prioritize political indoctrination over genuine learning. Young minds deserve genuine education. We must demand an immediate end to the politicization of curricula and insist on an education that empowers students to become informed, engaged, and responsible citizens.",Conservative
Fox News,"Green energy company Biden hosted at White House files for bankruptcy. Proterra, the electric bus company repeatedly celebrated by President Biden, filed for bankruptcy Monday, blaming various market ""headwinds"" for its financial struggles. The California-based company filed a voluntary Chapter 11 reorganization under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in the District of Delaware to ""strengthen its financial position."" Proterra said it would continue to operate its business as normal – including paying employee salaries and benefits, and compensating vendors and suppliers – during the process. ""The foundation we have built has set the stage for decarbonization across the commercial vehicle industry as a whole, and we recognize the great potential in all of our product offerings to enable this important transformation,"" Proterra CEO Gareth Joyce said in a statement. ""This is why we are taking action to separate each product line through the Chapter 11 reorganization process to maximize their independent potential."" ""While our best-in-class EV and battery technologies have set an industry standard, we have faced various market and macroeconomic headwinds, that have impacted our ability to efficiently scale all of our opportunities simultaneously,"" he added. ""As commercial vehicles accelerate toward electrification, we look forward to sharpening our focus as a leading EV battery technology supplier for the benefit of our many stakeholders"". The company confirmed the Chapter 11 bankruptcy in a 8-K filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission late Monday. Proterra, meanwhile, has been boosted by the Biden administration on multiple occasions since it took office in January 2021. On April 20, 2021, Biden hosted a virtual White House event to spotlight Proterra's business. During the event, Proterra executives took the president on a virtual tour of the company's South Carolina manufacturing facility where its buses are assembled. ""I want you all to know I used to be a bus driver,"" Biden remarked at the conclusion of the event. ""You think I'm kidding, I'm not. I worked my way through law school driving a school bus."" ""I'm going to come down and see you in person. So, I look forward to seeing y'all,"" he concluded. Biden also touted his support for billions of dollars in federal funding to accelerate the adoption of zero-emission transit buses and school buses during the tour. He has set a goal for all buses made in America to be zero-emissions by 2030.The president has since touted Proterra as an American electric vehicle success story in multiple speeches about his green energy goals. Earlier this year, he even appointed Joyce, Proterra's CEO, to serve on the White House Export Council, the principal national advisory committee on international trade. ""Gareth Joyce serves as Chief Executive Officer and Board Member at Proterra. Joyce brings to Proterra a long and distinguished career that spans the automotive, aviation, and consulting industries with a consistent focus on environmental sustainability and decarbonizing the transportation sector,"" the White House said on Feb. 28. ""Through his leadership, Joyce is growing Proterra’s EV battery manufacturing footprint in the United States and accelerating the transition of transit and other commercial vehicles to zero emission solutions,"" it added. In addition, Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm has faced widespread criticism for her ownership stake in Proterra. Granholm had served on Proterra’s board before her confirmation to lead the Department of Energy and continued holding shares of the company for months after her confirmation. ""While we are pleased that Secretary Granholm has eventually done the right thing and divested herself from Proterra, many questions remain unanswered,"" Michael Chamberlain, the director of Protect the Public’s Trust, said in May 2021 after Granholm sold her shares. ""While Secretary Granholm no longer owns the stock, the American public still deserves answers to why this perceived conflict lasted as long as it did.""",Conservative
Fox News,"California relying on fossil fuels for critical power amid record heat wave: 'We need natural gas'. The state of California continues to rely heavily upon fossil fuel-fired power plants to ensure its residents and businesses have access to reliable electricity amid the ongoing heat wave. According to data compiled by the California Independent System Operator, more than 40% of the state's total power grid supply derived from natural gas on Sunday, the largest share of any source. Renewable power, mainly solar energy, accounted for nearly 34%, but was only the largest energy source during peak sunlight hours between about 8 a.m. and 5:30 p.m. The state's grid is dependent on fossil fuel plants during the nighttime and morning hours when solar energy infrastructure isn't producing up to its capacity. That includes the period of highest electricity demand at around 7 p.m. when, on Sunday, natural gas generated 45% of the state's power compared to the 27% generated by renewables. ""California’s climate goals comes with a high cost that the public needs to understand,"" Kevin Slagle, a spokesperson for the Western States Petroleum Association, told Fox News Digital. ""The state will need three times the electricity production we have today, 30 times the number of EVs on the road and energy infrastructure will need to be built at a historical pace."" ""While these challenges and the costs associated with them are worked through, the facts are we need natural gas to power our grid,"" Slagle added. ""Even today with normal temperatures and clear skies, natural gas is the largest contributor to California’s power grid."" California's power output and resource mix on Sunday largely mimicked a common pattern in the state. Though incomplete data from Monday showed the state relied more heavily on natural gas, which accounted for 44% of energy generated, and less heavily on renewables which produced 30% of the state's electricity, while also looking to electricity imports, largely generated by fossil fuels, which accounted for nearly 11% of the total output. The continued importance of fossil fuels, especially natural gas, in California comes amid a record-breaking heat wave nationwide which has led to heightened pressure on the U.S. power grid to ensure a steady supply of electricity to Americans. In parts of California, residents have seen triple digit, and in some cases record-breaking, temperatures due to the heat dome over Southern California. Still, Democratic California Gov. Gavin Newsom has argued fossil fuels are to blame for climate change and has repeatedly advocated policies to wean the state off traditional power sources. ""The impacts of climate change have never been more clear — the hots continue to get hotter in our state and across the West putting millions of Californians at risk,"" Newsom said on July 11 after announcing a two-year $20 million education campaign about the dangers of hot weather. ""We’re asking everyone to stay alert to changing weather and take the necessary steps to keep themselves and their families safer from deadly heatwaves,"" he continued. In November, Newsom unveiled what he dubbed the ""world’s first detailed pathway to carbon neutrality."" The plan involves goals to slash greenhouse gas emissions by 85%, cut oil usage by 94% and deploy more solar and wind capacity over the next two decades. Overall, in 2021, the most recent year with data, wind and solar accounted for about 25% of total electricity generated in California while natural gas accounted for more than 50% of in-state electricity generation, according to the California Energy Commission.",Conservative
Fox News,"California winter waves may be growing as planet warms, researcher says. California winter wave heights may be increasing under climate change, researchers say. In a study published Tuesday in the Journal of Geophysical Research - Oceans, U.C. San Diego Scripps Institution of Oceanography's researcher emeritus Peter Bromirski used 90 years of seismic data to infer wave heights, revealing that the average heights of winter waves along the Golden State's coast has increased as the planet has warmed. Bromirski used seismic records dating back to 1931 to infer wave height, filtering out the ""noise"" of actual earthquakes. He explained that when waves reach shallow coastal waters, some of their energy is reflected back out to sea, and when that energy collides with approaching waves, the collision creates a downward pressure signal that is converted in seismic energy at the seafloor. This seismic energy moves inland in the form of seismic waves that can be detected by seismographs. The strength of that seismic signal directly relates to wave height, allowing inference of one from the other. Notably, buoys that directly measure wave heights along the California coast have only been collected since around 1980. After digitizing analog seismic records from 1931 to 1992, Bromirski was able to transform the data into wave heights. His analysis found that post-1970 California's average winter wave height has increased by 13% in comparison with the average between 1931 and 1969. Between 1996 and 2016, there were about twice as many storm events that produced waves greater than 13 feet high along the California coast, compared with the years 1949 to 1969. ""After 1970, there is a consistently higher rate of large wave events,"" Bromirski said. ""And the fact that this change coincides with the acceleration of global warming near 1970 is consistent with increased storm activity over the North Pacific resulting from climate change."" Should winter waves off California continue to grow under climate change, it could amplify the effects of sea-level rise and have significant implications for coastal flooding and erosion.""Waves ride on top of the sea level, which is rising due to climate change,"" Bromirski stated. ""When sea levels are elevated even further during storms, more wave energy can potentially reach vulnerable sea cliffs, flood low-lying regions, or damage coastal infrastructure.""   To understand how results compared with atmospheric patterns over the northern Pacific, Bromirski looked at the Aleutian Low, a wintertime low pressure system near Alaska’s Aleutian Islands. The study found that the intensity of this low has generally increased since 1970. A more pronounced Aleutian Low typically corresponds to increased storm activity and intensity. ""That intensification is consistent with increased storm activity,"" Bromirski added. ""If Pacific storms and the waves they produce keep intensifying as climate change progresses and sea-level rises, it creates a new dimension that needs to be considered in terms of trying to anticipate coastal impacts in California.""",Conservative
Fox News,"Biden admin quietly settles with eco groups to restrict oil drilling in Gulf of Mexico. The Biden administration quietly entered into a court settlement late Friday with a coalition of environmental groups who have pushed for more wildlife protections from offshore oil development activity. In a stipulated stay agreement filed with the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland, the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) agreed to a number of conditions requested by the coalition of four eco groups led by the Sierra Club which, in response, agreed to temporarily pause litigation in the case. Fossil fuel industry groups, though, blasted the settlement, saying it would hamper domestic energy production. ""This private settlement agreement between the federal government and environmental activists places unfounded restrictions on operations in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico that severely hamper America's ability to produce energy in a region that is responsible for the lowest carbon-intensive barrels in the world,"" the American Petroleum Institute (API), National Ocean Industries Association and EnerGeo Alliance said in a joint statement.  ""Despite no evidence to warrant this far-reaching ban on operations after extensive data collections, today’s agreement undermines the integrity of legitimate conservation and habitat protection efforts, violates the explicit directives of Congress in enacting the Inflation Reduction Act, and harms America’s energy independence,"" the two industry groups added. Under the settlement, the Biden administration agreed to create expanded protection areas for the Rice’s whale species that environmental groups argued weren't properly protected under previous assessments. However, the government stated it had no ""reason to believe"" whales would be harmed by oil and gas activities in the newly expanded Gulf of Mexico protection areas. In addition, the administration agreed to exclude about 11 million acres with rich oil resources in the Gulf of Mexico from future lease sales. That acreage would likely have been available for future lease sales mandated under the Inflation Reduction Act. And the federal government will impose new restrictions on oil and gas vessels, but not the thousands of vessels operated in other industries in the area. As such, oil and gas vessels must operate at slower speeds, which could cut transit windows to less than 40% of the time annually and 25% during the winter, according to API. Overall, the restrictions could have the impact of ensuring that future lease sales in the Gulf of Mexico aren't economically viable. The case dates back nearly three years when, in October 2020, the environmental group coalition — which additionally included the Center for Biological Diversity, Friends of the Earth and Turtle Island Restoration Network — sued the NMFS for failing to properly assess the oil industry impacts on endangered and threatened marine wildlife in the Gulf of Mexico. The lawsuit came after the NMFS coordinated a multiagency consultation studying the effects all federally regulated oil and gas activities would have on species listed under the Endangered Species Act in the Gulf of Mexico over the next 50 years. The groups argued in the original complaint that the NMFS' biological opinion resulting from its consultation was not based on the best science. ""The feds are ignoring the harm offshore drilling in the Gulf does to sperm whales, loggerhead sea turtles and other endangered species. They’ve shunned science, and we need the court to intervene,"" Kristen Monsell, a senior attorney at the Center for Biological Diversity, said at the time. The NMFS declined to comment and the Sierra Club didn't respond to a request for comment.",Conservative
Fox News,"Study casts doubt on electric vehicles' climate, cost benefits: 'Won't achieve the goals intended'.  A new report published by the Manhattan Institute threw cold water on the purported climate and cost benefits of electric vehicles (EVs) widely touted by lawmakers and automakers. Overall, the rapid electrification of the U.S. transportation sector would increase consumer costs, make the electric grid more vulnerable to blackouts, threaten national security and may not even lead to fewer greenhouse gas emissions, according to the paper titled ""Electric Vehicles for Everyone? The Impossible Dream"" and authored by Manhattan Institute senior fellow Mark Mills. ""I think it's morally consequential. It's geopolitically consequential and socially, economically consequential,"" Mills told Fox News Digital in an interview. ""The subsidies and the mandates run the risk of causing maybe the biggest misallocation of capital in modern times in the industrial markets. Hundreds of billions of dollars are going to be spent chasing these mandates, requirements."" ""And it won't, as the report shows, it won't achieve the goals intended and the attempt to do so will have enormous economic and social costs because the underlying premises are either incorrect, too poorly understood or too difficult to quantify in order to take the actions that are being taken,"" he continued. Mills said the government push to aggressively electrify the transportation sector over the coming years is based on the premises that it will both help the environment by lowering economy-wide carbon emissions and help save consumers money through lower fueling costs while keeping car prices co-equal with current prices. However, Mills' report highlights that emissions and costs are subject a wide range of conditions. ""It depends on when and where you charge the vehicle,"" he told Fox News Digital. ""Then you have to add to that, the emissions that occur before you get the vehicle in your driveway for the first time because all vehicles entail CO2 emissions associated with the energy you use to build the vehicle. You use of materials and machines to build everything."" ""For an internal combustion engine, something on the order of 15 to 20% of the emissions that is associated with the vehicle over its lifetime of operating occur before you drive it,"" he continued. ""With an electric vehicle, the share of emissions range from 15% to 100% of total lifecycle emissions. And they're far greater than the conventional vehicle because you're building a fuel tank, a battery, on difficult-to-acquire metals."" Mills added that there are ""realistic scenarios"" where driving an electric vehicle will cause greater global emissions than driving an internal combustion engine. His report, meanwhile, comes as lawmakers at the federal and state level continue to take aim at traditional gas-powered vehicles while boosting EVs. In December, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) finalized rules targeting heavy-duty trucks that it said at the time were the ""strongest-ever national clean air standards to cut smog- and soot-forming emissions"" from such vehicles. The new standards went into effect on March 27 and will be implemented for new trucks sold after 2027. Then, in April, the EPA proposed the most aggressive federal tailpipe emissions targeting light- and medium-duty emissions ever crafted. If finalized and implemented, a staggering 67% of new sedan, crossover, SUV and light truck; up to 50% of bus and garbage truck; 35% of short-haul freight tractor; and 25% of long-haul freight tractor purchases could be electric by 2032, the White House projected. The EPA also reinstated in March 2022 California’s authority under the Clean Air Act to implement its own emission standards and electric vehicle sales mandates, allowing other states to also adopt California's rules. Months later, in August, the California Air Resources Board, a leading state environmental agency, approved regulations mandating that all car purchases in the state — which leads the country in annual car sales — are zero emissions by 2035. Overall, it is estimated that the nearly 20 states set to adopt California's regulations represent more than 40% of total U.S. car purchases. ""Ultimately, if implemented, bans on conventionally powered vehicles will lead to draconian impediments to affordable and convenient driving and a massive misallocation of capital in the world’s $4 trillion automotive industry,"" Mills wrote in his report. ""Imagining a hypothetical all-EV world requires acknowledging the unavoidable fact of a rats’ nest of assumptions, guesses, and ambiguities regarding emissions,"" he concluded. ""Much of the necessary data may never be collectible in any normal regulatory fashion, given the technical uncertainties and the variety and opacity of geographic factors, as well as the proprietary nature of many of the processes."" ""Those uncertainties could lead to havoc if U.S. and European regulators enshrine 'green disclosures' in legally binding ways, and it all will be subject to manipulation, if not fraud.""",Conservative
Fox News,"Biden admin crackdown on dishwashers faces widespread opposition. The Biden administration's proposed regulations targeting dishwashers is facing pushback from a coalition of 19 industry and consumer groups. The coalition — led by the Competitive Enterprise Institute (CEI) — filed comments with the Department of Energy (DOE) late Tuesday, arguing that the rules are unnecessary, overly burdensome and would harm consumers, and urging the agency to withdraw the proposal. The DOE first unveiled the proposed regulations two months ago and the public comment period for the rulemaking concluded Tuesday. ""The proposed rule would tighten the energy and water efficiency standards for residential dishwashers, despite the fact that the standards currently in effect are causing serious problems for consumers,"" the letter stated. ""Those problems include cycle times an hour or more longer than were the norm before the standards went into effect, as well as other adverse impacts."" ""The proposed rule would exacerbate these problems and thus further violate the consumer protections built into the law,"" it continued. ""For these reasons, we believe the proposed rule should be withdrawn and that the Department of Energy should shift its focus to addressing the drawbacks caused by its existing dishwasher regulations."" ""This Administration is using all of the tools at our disposal to save Americans money while promoting innovations that will reduce carbon pollution and combat the climate crisis,"" Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm said in a statement after the rules were unveiled. In early May, the DOE announced the new dishwasher energy efficiency standards alongside regulations similarly targeting electric motors and beverage vending machines. The agency said the rules would help save Americans and families millions of dollars ""while tackling the climate crisis."" The dishwasher rules, the DOE said, would take effect in 2027 and save consumers an estimated $168 million per year on utility bills. And the regulations are projected to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 12.5 million metric tons. However, the DOE was criticized over the rule by industry groups and Republican lawmakers alike who noted the agency has already issued recent dishwasher efficiency regulations and that consumers are currently free to choose pricier efficient appliance models. According to the CEI, the DOE has already regulated dishwasher efficiency standards on four separate occasions. The current proposal represents the fifth rulemaking taking aim at the popular home appliance. ""While each of the Biden administration’s recently-proposed appliance measures raises a unique set of risks for consumers, the proposed dishwasher rule at issue here is particularly harmful,"" the comment letter led by CEI added. ""As it is, the existing energy and water efficiency measures for dishwashers have led to widespread and well-documented dissatisfaction over cycle times that have more than doubled from about an hour to two or more."" ""The proposal to tighten these provisions would very likely make things worse. Further, since the existing energy and water limits are already quite stringent, the proposal to tighten them would generate very little marginal savings,"" the groups wrote. ""Overall, dishwashers may well have the distinction of being the most overregulated home appliance, yet DOE now seeks to regulate them further."" The letter further argued that the efficiency standards would result in lower performance and cause lead to a higher number of repairs. For example, it notes dishwashers that comply with the proposed standards use less water and don't properly flush out food particles leading to mold and debris buildup. It also stated the energy and water savings generated by the regulations are not significant. Citing the DOE's own data, the letter notes the regulations would save consumers $17 over the life of a standard dishwasher, which it estimates to be 15 to 16 years. ""This miniscule benefit is the very real risk of greatly diminished performance and convenience for consumers."" In addition to dishwashers, over the last several months, the DOE has unveiled new standards for a wide variety of other appliances including gas stoves, clothes washers, refrigerators and air conditioners. And the administration boasted in December that it had taken 110 actions on energy efficiency rules in 2022 alone as part of its climate agenda. According to the current federal Unified Agenda, a government-wide, semiannual list that highlights regulations agencies plan to propose or finalize within the next 12 months, the Biden administration is additionally moving forward with rules impacting dozens more appliances, including consumer furnaces, pool pumps, battery chargers, ceiling fans and dehumidifiers. The Heritage Foundation, Institute for Energy Research, Heartland Institute, American Consumer Institute, Consumers’ Research, Americans for Prosperity, and American First Policy Institute were among the groups joining CEI in signing the comment letter Tuesday.",Conservative

Fox News,"Washington state’s nation-leading gasoline prices should serve as a warning. Vacationers hitting the highways currently face a nationwide average price of $3.52 per gallon of gasoline, according AAA. However, the price varies widely among states. California usually leads the nation and is currently at a sky-high $4.85 per gallon, but this year it has been eclipsed by Washington state at a hefty $4.98 per gallon. The reason is clear – costly climate change policies adopted by both states – and it provides lessons for the rest of the nation. The cheapest gas is in Mississippi at $2.96 per gallon, and several other states are under $3.30. This gives a real-world yardstick of what is possible at current oil prices. So what explains the almost $2 extra for gas in Washington and California? Part of it is state gasoline taxes. The 18.4 cents per gallon federal tax is uniform, but state taxes vary, and both Washington state and California are higher than the average of 39 cents per gallon. Further, tough state refinery regulations and gasoline specifications also explain part of the difference. But what really sets these two states apart from the others is their climate policies targeting gasoline. California acted first with its low carbon fuel standard and cap and trade program, both of which have been around for years and are estimated to add 47 cents per gallon to the current price. But Washington has been making up for lost time in 2023 with its stringent new Climate Commitment Act. Like California’s measures, Washington’s effectively puts a price on the carbon content of gasoline sold in the state, and is a big reason behind the estimated 35 to 52 cent jump in prices compared to neighboring states, according to Todd Myers of the Washington Policy Center. And it will get worse, as this is just the first year of the law, which gets progressively more stringent in the years ahead. Many proponents of the Climate Commitment Act predicted the price increases and asserted that the extra pain at the pump is needed to wean drivers away from gasoline and fight climate change. But now they have changed their tune in response to the unpopularity of the measure and are blaming corporate greed by speculating that the law somehow provided fuel producers with the opportunity to manipulate market prices higher. However, the increases are entirely in line with the per gallon cost of the program so far. Washington Gov. Jay Inslee has similarly attempted to shift blame for his support of the Climate Commitment Act -- as well as his earlier claims that the per gallon cost impact ""would be pennies"" -- by making unsupported claims of industry price gouging. He has also noted that a pipeline serving the state is currently offline for maintenance, but the Olympic pipeline also serves Oregon, where gasoline prices are 35 cents per gallon lower. Inslee considers climate change the ""defining challenge of our time"" and has thus far shot down any potential changes to the law that might cushion the consumer impact. The warning for other states and the federal government could not be clearer – any serious attempt to penalize gasoline for its supposed contribution to climate change will lead to noticeably more pain at the pump. Unfortunately, the Biden administration is every bit supportive of this agenda as Inslee and is inching the country in the same direction via a number of measures done in the name of addressing climate change. These measures include curtailed oil leasing on federal lands, opposition to Keystone XL and other needed pipelines, new fees applicable to drilling operations, and pressure on banks not to lend to oil companies. In time this agenda could push nationwide prices much closer to what Washingtonians and Californians are experiencing today.",Conservative
Fox News,"Biden administration rigged internal analysis, softening blow of power plant regulations. The Biden administration's internal analysis of its proposed power plant crackdown is based on overly rosy assumptions that experts argue vastly downplay how the regulations are projected to impact power grid reliability and costs. The Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) regulatory impact analysis (RIA) of its power plant plan produces a ""remarkable underestimation"" of actual impacts, according to a report released this week by the Chamber of Commerce Global Energy Institute. The EPA created a questionable baseline scenario, failed to factor in projected electric vehicle growth and overestimated the development of carbon capture technology, the report showed. ""What we really found out with our analysis is that EPA essentially looked at the different knobs and levers on their economic analysis of this and turned every one of them in a favorable direction to minimize the costs and amplify the benefits,"" report co-author Heath Knakmuhs, the Global Energy Institute's vice president and policy counsel, told Fox News Digital in an interview. ""If someone were to actually provide a real straight-laced sort of no-nonsense look at this, the costs would be far more significant, thereby essentially opening this up to being a more significant rulemaking."" In May, the EPA unveiled the power plant regulations targeting fossil fuel-fired power plant emissions as part of the administration's broader climate agenda. In its announcement, the agency said the plan ""would avoid"" 617 million metric tons of carbon pollution through 2042 via new standards forcing plants to either utilize carbon capture technology or shut down. But it added the regulations would have a ""negligible cost."" However, the Global Energy Institute report Wednesday showed that, in its RIA released alongside the regulations, the EPA packed the vast majority of the plan's projected emissions reductions into a ""baseline scenario."" That means the agency's emissions reductions, and costs accompanying those reductions, would occur without the EPA plan, according to the RIA.""There is a massive claim of emission reductions occurring without the rule at all,"" Knakmuhs told Fox News Digital. ""Essentially, they take the use of the Inflation Reduction Act that was signed into law last August, and they give a very rosy outlook of how that act is going to transform the electric system in all the ways that actually, in many ways, would negate the need for this rule."" For example, the RIA states that, under a baseline scenario without the EPA's proposed regulations, power sector emissions are expected to plummet 80% below 2005 levels by 2040. With the regulations, though, the agency assumes emissions will decline 81%, a meager 1% difference compared to the baseline scenario. ""Why is this important? Because the completely unrealistic baseline assumptions change the entire cost-benefit equation. When agency mandates are met even without the rule, the forecasted compliance costs on utilities and the resultant economic impacts on families and businesses effectively disappear,"" the Global Energy Institute report states. The EPA's RIA projects the impacts its plan would have on consumer electricity prices based on its baseline. It concludes the regulations would increase prices 0% nationwide through 2040. Industry groups and experts have loudly rejected the notion that such emissions reductions could take place without significant cost impacts.  Further, the baseline scenario substantially deviates from projections made by the Energy Information Administration (EIA), the nonpartisan statistics office within the Department of Energy. The EIA's 2023 forecast, which factors in Inflation Reduction Act provisions, says natural gas prices will increase to $3.94 per million Btu in 2040, 97% higher than what EPA says the price will be in its baseline. ""It's reliability at the end of the day because they're essentially modeling and ignoring this huge gap between where the supply will end up under this rule and where the demand will be underneath this and other rules,"" said Knakmuhs. Dan Byers, the Global Energy Institute's vice president for policy who co-authored the report, said he was concerned about the actual cost and reliability impacts of the EPA's plan but added the Biden administration may be trying to avoid legal scrutiny with its baseline projections. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in June 2022 that a similar Obama-era rule limiting power plant emissions under the Clean Air Act was unconstitutional since Congress never granted the EPA the explicit power to issue such regulations. ""If it goes to the courts and folks say, 'Look, this is a really big deal. This is a transformative rule. We're not sure about your authorities here,' EPA can say, 'It's not transformative at all. It hardly does anything,'"" Byers told Fox News Digital.""The reason we did this report is to shed some light on it and, hopefully, EPA — we're really calling on EPA to do a sensitivity analysis. Can you run the numbers using EIA forecasts of gas prices and closures and emissions?"" he said. ""Or at least respond and defend why it is you think that all this stuff will happen in the baseline."" In addition, in their report, Byers and Knakmuhs noted the EPA neglects to factor in added electricity demand expected to be created by its own regulations, forcing increased consumer adoption of electric vehicles.  And they found the agency also relies too heavily on carbon capture technology which is being used at just one facility in the world, the Boundary Dam Power Station in Canada. Although the Chamber of Commerce has advocated for carbon capture, the report states the technology is still unproven at scale. ""EPA will closely evaluate the Chamber’s report and will consider and respond to the report along with other comments received during the public comment period for the proposed rules, which remains open until August 8, 2023,"" an EPA spokesperson told Fox News Digital.",Conservative

""With much of the country and the world experiencing these record temps, at what point do certain areas just simply become uninhabitable for humans?"" Lassman said Fryer's concern is ""actually, probably closer than you might think,"" highlighting the widely denounced report which warned that in some areas of the U.S. south and others regions of the world, heatwaves will become so dangerous in less than fifty years that human life there will be unsustainable if no action is taken to reassess the world's climate policies. ""That report also states that up to one-third of the global population will start experiencing life-threatening heat conditions, something that we currently only see in places like the Sahara,"" Lassman added. ""This all means climate migration, people in the hottest areas with the most vulnerable populations moving to avoid the heat and drought conditions,"" Lassman continued. ""That of course, will put pressure on the cities and towns they move to and the heat [is] projected to cause this ripple effect this century."" ""The clock is ticking,"" Fryer replied. The study in question, released in October 2022 by the United Nations and the Red Cross, predicted that by 2070, rising temperatures could make climate conditions in certain areas of the world ""warmer than conditions deemed suitable for human life to flourish."" The study also claimed that cutting down on greenhouse gasses could reduce the number of people affected by up to 50%. Critics dismissed the report as just another study in a long string of catastrophic climate change warnings and calls to action from the U.N. dating back decades. The NBC discussion was prompted by reports circulating last week suggesting that Earth hit its hottest day in at least 44 years and likely much longer and comes as excessive heat warnings were issued across the U.S. over the Fourth of July holiday. Many heat advisories remain in place across the world as sweltering temperatures are expected to break records across various regions this summer.",Conservative
CNN,"FEMA announces $3 billion for climate resiliency as time runs low for Congress to replenish its disaster fund In a record-breaking year of disasters, the Federal Emergency Management Agency is announcing nearly $3 billion Monday for communities to build resiliency against climate change-fueled extreme weather.The new money, which will come from Congress’s bipartisan infrastructure law passed last year, is being announced just as the agency is running out of disaster-relief funds and a dangerous hurricane is bearing down on Florida. FEMA needs Congress to approve additional spending when it’s back in session to prevent the agency from falling into the red.The infrastructure law contained billions of dollars to help make communities more resilient to the impacts of a warming planet, like rising sea levels and stronger storms. FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell told CNN studies have shown resilience is an investment that pays off.“Every dollar that we spend in resilience – like this money right here – saves us $6 in response and recovery costs,” Criswell told CNN. “We want to reduce that complexity of the recoveries, which saves money on the disaster relief fund, because then we don’t have to spend as much to help communities recover from these types of disasters.” The resiliency funding, the details of which were shared first with CNN, is coming from a different source than what props up FEMA’s disaster relief fund – the money the agency uses to respond to storms. That fund is dangerously close to empty in a year that has had a record number of billion-dollar disasters to-date and a hurricane taking aim at Florida this week. Criswell told CNN that the agency’s disaster relief fund is projected to run out of money “toward the middle of September” unless Congress passes additional funding to replenish it. Congress is expected to return after Labor Day.Despite bipartisan support in the Senate, House conservatives have warned they are unhappy with disaster funding being tied to additional funding for Ukraine – which could set up a protracted spending battle. If funding isn’t passed soon after Congress returns in early September, it could hamper the agency’s response to future Atlantic hurricanes and delay long-term recovery efforts in Maui.FEMA has already factored into its spending the immediate response to the Maui wildfires, Hurricane Hilary in California and the initial response to Idalia, Criswell said. The agency is monitoring the disaster relief fund “daily,” she said, to see if they need to adjust “to make sure that we always have enough to support lifesaving efforts.” “We are putting plans in place for how we would use our tools to help make sure that we always have funding to support the immediate lifesaving needs,” Criswell said. Administration officials hope the infusion of new funds for climate resiliency will help make communities stronger and safer. In a first, FEMA is awarding resilience funding for extreme heat, agreeing to fund a project proposed by Portland, Oregon, to plant 10,500 trees over the next three years to provide more shade, improve air quality, and help with flooding during major rainstorms. “That project is going to be a really great example for other communities to see what’s in the realm of possibility to help combat the extreme heat that we have been experiencing over the last several years and is continuing to increase,” Criswell said. “This is the first one that really allows us to use trees to help reduce the urban heat islands that communities have.” Other projects that will be funded include strengthening the grid in Jefferson Parish, Louisiana, to withstand 150-mph winds and keep power on during hurricanes; installing new sewer mains in Detroit’s flood-prone Jefferson Chalmers neighborhood; and upgrading Nevada’s Hobart Creek Reservoir Dam, both to protect water levels and keep the dam safe. In addition, FEMA is dispensing millions of dollars to help make communities more resilient to flooding, funding 149 projects in 28 states and the District of Columbia under its flood mitigation assistance program. The funding will be used to elevate some homes and acquire and demolish others that have flooded repeatedly. Some of the projects include elevating 84 structures and opening new green space in east Baton Rouge Parish, Louisiana, and elevating 19 homes in the Florida Keys using piers and concrete footings. In addition, the funding will be used to buy and demolish repeatedly flooded buildings in Machesney Park, Illinois, turning the area into green space. “Our local and community partners are the first responders when extreme weather events unfold, and they are on the front lines of building our nation’s resilience to the impacts of climate change,” Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas said in a statement. Beyond FEMA, climate resilience has become a large focus for President Joe Biden, whose White House is working with agencies to deploy $50 billion in total resilience and adaptation money passed in the infrastructure law and Inflation Reduction Act. Amid an unprecedented year of disasters, Criswell added it’s critical for communities across the nation to make themselves stronger and more prepared as climate change-fueled weather pummels the US year-round.“We have typically postured ourselves for the peak of hurricane season as our busiest time of the year,” Criswell said. “What we are seeing is it’s a year-round operational tempo like we have never seen before. We have to make sure that we are working with our teams every day to be able to address the severe weather events happening year-round.”",Liberal
Daily Progress,"Climate change may force more farmers and ranchers to consider irrigation — at a steep cost The Texas ranch where Gilda Jackson trains and sells horses has been plagued by grasshoppers this year, a problem that only gets worse when the hatch quickens in times of heat and drought. Jackson watched this summer as the insects chewed through a 35-acre pasture she badly needs for hay; what they didn't destroy, the sun burned up.Irrigation might have saved Jackson's hay, but she and her husband rejected the idea about 10 years ago over the cost: as much as $75,000 for a new well and all the equipment. But now — with an extended drought and another U.S. heat wave this week that will broil her land about an hour northwest of Dallas for days in 100-degree-plus temperatures — Jackson said she is “kind of rethinking.” Many other farmers and ranchers in the U.S. might be forced to do the same in coming decades, according to recent research into the expected effects of the rising heat and more frequent weather extremes associated with climate change. That's if they even can. Some places in the U.S. are already struggling with groundwater depletion, such as California, Arizona, Nebraska and other parts of the central Plains. “There’s no surprise that in the future when it gets hotter and there’s more demand for water, people are going to be using more water,” said Jonathan Winter, an associate professor of geography at Dartmouth College and an author on a new study on future U.S. irrigation costs and benefits in Communications Earth & Environment. Winter and his team used a computer model to look at how heat and drought might affect crop production by the middle and end of this century, given multiple scenarios for the emissions of warming greenhouse gases. In places like California and Texas where “everyone is dropping their straw into the glass” of groundwater, as Winter put it, current levels of irrigation won't be viable in the long term because there isn’t enough water. But use of irrigation may grow where groundwater supply isn’t presently an issue. In much of the Midwest, including the corn- and soybean-rich states of Iowa, Illinois, Indiana and the Dakotas, farmers might see a benefit in the next 50 years from installing irrigation infrastructure. That’s an expensive investment, and whether it will pay off may depend on humans' ability to stem the worst effects of climate change. A worst-case scenario would involve one generation investing in costly irrigation equipment, only for the next to see them fail to keep crops alive through extreme heat and weather. There are many irrigation methods for row crops, but the most common is pivot irrigation — the long strands of pipes mounted on wheels that are pulled in a circle around a water source to sprinkle water onto a field. The equipment can easily cost hundreds of thousands of dollars, plus the cost of drilling a new well if needed, along with the electricity to pull up the water. But if the system boosts yields and provides a return of $50 an acre or more, it can pay off well for a farmer, said Brady Brewer, an associate professor of agricultural economics at Purdue University. While scientists are confident in the warming effects of greenhouse gas emissions, precipitation is harder to nail down, especially in the Midwest, said Dave Gochis, a senior scientist with the National Center for Atmospheric Research who was not involved with Winter’s study. Climate change produces more weather extremes, meaning both an increased risk of flash droughts — quick, intense periods of short-term heat and dry weather — and more heavy rain and flooding events as precipitation increases with more water in the atmosphere. “That means we need to be more nimble and agile in how we manage water resources,” Gochis said. Brewer hasn't seen much increased interest in irrigation from Midwest farmers yet. So far, a surplus of water has been the bigger issue in many places, but if yields start showing losses in the coming years due to worsening heat and flash droughts, “that's when farmers will invest,” he said. Farmers who don't choose irrigation, for now, might cope by planning ahead. They could choose different crops with different water needs from season to season or be compensated for fallowing fields in times of water stress. Or they might use tools like the one developed by North Carolina State researchers Sankar Arumugam, a professor, and Hemant Kumar, a Ph.D. candidate. They recently helped create a computer modeling tool, outlined in the journal Water Resources Research, which they hope will help farmers and water managers use a combination of seasonal forecasts and other data to find a sweet spot for balancing crop revenue and water use. In the Southeast, where they focused their work and where water resources are plentiful, “it’s more of a proactive strategy” for people who already have irrigation equipment, Arumugam said, “so that we don’t overexploit the resources that are in place.” Irrigation, used responsibly, can be part of adapting to climate change, but “it’s a moving target,” Winter said. He called for supporting farmers who have to make hard decisions as they adapt to climate change. But he also urged action to limit climate change’s worst effects. Farmers need resources to make adjustments, but especially in the West, “there’s only so much water,” he said.",Liberal
Daily Progress,"Climate change doubled chance of weather conditions that led to record Quebec fires, researchers say Climate change more than doubled the chances of the hot, dry weather that helped fuel the unprecedented wildfire season in eastern Canada that's driven thousands from their homes and blanketed parts of the U.S. with choking smoke, according to an analysis. What's more, human-caused climate change made the fire season in Quebec — from May through July — 50% more intense than it otherwise would have been and increased the likelihood of similarly severe fire seasons at least sevenfold, researchers said. ""The biggest takeaway is, this is because of us that we have seen so many fires this year,” due to greenhouse gas emissions, said Yan Boulanger, a research scientist in forest ecology for Natural Resources Canada. He was one of 16 researchers who collaborated on the analysis for World Weather Attribution, an initiative that aims to quickly evaluate the role of climate change in the aftermath of extreme weather events. Canada is in the middle of its worst wildfire season on record, with more than 5,800 fires burning over 59,000 square miles from one end of the country to the other, according the the Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre. In Quebec alone, more than 20,000 square miles has burned so far this year — an area 176 times larger than all of last year. Though the analysis, released Tuesday, looked only at a region of Quebec, hot temperatures and drought conditions also were at a record level in the rest of Canada, “and we know that those fire-prone conditions also are increasing in severity, especially out West,” Boulanger said. Ongoing wildfires have burned dozens of structures in a resort area of British Columbia and prompted authorities to evacuate about 20,000 people from Yellowknife, the capital of the Northwest Territories. The analysis estimated the peak intensity of the fire weather by looking at real-world observations in a metric called the Fire Weather Index — which estimates wildfire risk by combining temperature, wind speed, humidity and precipitation — averaged over seven days. The researchers then compared that to a world without climate change using multiple computer simulations and historical weather data, a technique widely accepted in the scientific community. They found that the fire-weather conditions this year were twice as likely. They also assessed the cumulative effect of the weather conditions from January to July, determining that the duration of those conditions was seven times more likely. Peter Reich, a forest ecologist who wasn't involved in the analysis, said he was glad researchers didn't try to prove climate change caused the fires, but instead looked at the probability that the conditions that led to this year’s fire season would have occurred with or without climate change. “To me, the scariest finding is just the magnitude of the greater likelihood of intense fire weather because of climate change,” said Reich, head of the Institute for Global Change Biology at the University of Michigan and a professor at the University of Minnesota. “It’s not just 10% more likely or 20% — there’s a 600%” greater likelihood. Although the analysis did a good job of assessing extreme fire weather, it didn’t capture how broadly it affected the entire country, especially in the arid West, which would show an even stronger connection to climate change, said Mike Flannigan, a professor for wildland fire at Thompson Rivers University in British Columbia. “I've never seen such a wide geographical area in Canada on fire at the same time … and fire season is not over yet,” he said. Reich said the findings likely would apply across the planet because hotter temperatures increase the drying power of the air, and climate change makes fire vulnerability, severity and risk much higher by increasing the flammability of the materials and weather conditions that will produce and carry fire at the same time. “It kind of feeds on itself,” he added. Canada’s fire season began early, after snow melted quickly and the warmest May-June period in more than 80 years combined with sparse rainfall to dry out vegetation and make it more flammable. Windy conditions also drove the wildfires throughout most of the country. In Canada, 5% of the population identifies as Indigenous — First Nation, Métis or Inuit — yet researchers say they were disproportionately affected by wildfires because their communities often are isolated and in some of the most fire-prone areas, like the boreal forest. Scientists say that risks will increase as the planet continues to warm. ""That's a very big wake-up call” for communities that need to adapt, Boulanger said. Flannigan said widespread, hotter fires are “the new reality” and will require new approaches to preventing and battling increasingly dangerous and intense blazes. ""Unfortunately, we're going to see more fire and smoke in the future,"" he said, explaining that there won't be enough rain to compensate drier fuels, leading to higher-intensity fires that are becoming almost impossible to extinguish. He added: “We're really in uncharted territory.”",Liberal
Daily Progress,"Presidential debate shows how GOP candidates are struggling to address concerns about climate change The eight Republican presidential candidates on the debate stage were asked to raise their hands if they believed human behavior is causing climate change. Not a single hand went up. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis shut down the question and attacked the “corporate media.” Echoing the words of former President Donald Trump, Vivek Ramaswamy called climate change “a hoax” and a “wet blanket on our economy.” Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., insisted that more serious environmental threats are coming from China, India and Africa. Just one Republican, former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley, said during Wednesday night's debate in Milwaukee that climate change “is real.” A day later, frustrated leaders in the GOP's small but growing movement of environmental activists said their party must do better. In fact, some young conservatives confronted Ramaswamy at a gathering after the debate and told him his answer was particularly unhelpful. “We’re getting to a point where Republicans are losing winnable elections because they’re alienating people that care about climate change,” Christopher Barnard, the Republican president of the American Conservation Coalition, the largest conservative environmental group in the nation, said Thursday. As the 2024 presidential contest begins in earnest, the Republican Party is struggling to reconcile rising concerns about climate change — especially young people — with the GOP's older base, which largely rejects climate science as a liberal conspiracy theory. Scientists overwhelmingly agree that heat-trapping gases released from the combustion of fossil fuels are pushing up global temperatures, upending weather patterns and endangering animal species. Some Republican leaders have acknowledged they cannot ignore climate change altogether. House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., has called for planting 1 trillion trees to help protect the environment. But the solutions long promoted by Democrats and environmental advocates — government action to force emissions reductions — remains a nonstarter with the GOP's presidential candidates. “The climate change agenda is a hoax,” Ramaswamy said during the debate, repeating the line for emphasis, even as some younger people in the audience booed. “The reality is more people are dying of climate change policies than they actually are of climate change.” None of Ramaswamy’s competitors, eager to attack him on other issues during the two-hour debate, challenged him directly on climate, even after the debate moderators highlighted new evidence that climate change is causing major problems. Former Vice President Mike Pence, who was silent on climate change during the debate, suggested Thursday that it is largely a matter of messaging for the GOP. “Look the climate is changing, but I believe the issue is what we do about it,” Pence said, condemning Democratic-backed policies such as the so-called Green New Deal. “It’s all just about communicating a different vision.” Meanwhile, conditions across the country and the world are creating new urgency for the GOP to take climate change seriously. Heavy rains poured on Cleveland during the debate and Detroit flooded overnight. Wildfires in Canada have led to smoky, polluted air in much of the United States, while a catastrophic wildfire in Hawaii was the deadliest in more than a century. Southern California was hit with a tropical storm for the first time in decades. But the biggest climate effect has been the heat. July saw global daily and monthly temperatures hotter than modern equipment had ever recorded. Some scientists said it was the hottest in about 120,000 years, based on tree rings and other proxy records. The world’s oceans have set records for heat, both on the surface and deeper, every month since spring. Florida saw 100-degree water and unprecedented coral bleaching. The presidential debate ""underscored the fact that one of the two parties (the GOP) not only refuses to act on the climate crisis, but refuses to even acknowledge it exists,” University of Pennsylvania climate scientist Michael Mann said in an email. “It is a disqualifying position on the defining challenge of our time.” “The party will lose a huge chunk of voters, especially women ad younger voters if it adopts this stance,” he said. Most people in the United States (62%) say the federal government is doing too little to reduce climate change, according to a September 2022 poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. Even as U.S. adults don’t think the government is doing enough, there’s a clear division among Republicans. Half of Republicans under age 45 say the government isn’t addressing climate change enough, compared with just 32% of older Republicans. Younger Republicans also say they feel anxious when discussing climate change at a higher rate than older Republicans. Barnard, of the American Conservation Coalition, said it was a win for conservative environmentalists that the climate question was even asked. But he said that his party must do better and he offered advice to the GOP's presidential class. “You don’t have to be the biggest climate champion,” Barnard said. “If you just say, ‘Climate change is real, and we’re going to have some sort of solution,’ that's enough for most voters.”",Liberal
Daily Progress,"Biden administration spending $150M to help small forest owners benefit from selling carbon credits The Biden administration said Tuesday it will spend $150 million to help owners of small parcels of forestland partner with companies willing to pay them for carbon offsets and other environmental credits. Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack announced the grant program at a conference of Black landowners in coastal Georgia, saying programs that allow private companies to offset their own emissions by paying to protect trees have disproportionately benefited owners of large acreage. “In order for those small, privately held forest owners to be able to do what they need and want to do requires a bit of technical help,"" Vilsack told about 150 conference attendees in a church ballroom in Brunswick. ""And sometimes that technical help is not easy to find. And it’s certainly not easy to afford.” The grant money comes from the sweeping climate law passed by Congress just over a year ago and targets underserved landowners, including military veterans and new farmers, as well as families owning 2,500 acres (1,011 hectares) or less. The goal is to protect more tracts of U.S. forest to help fight climate change. The past decade has seen a rapidly expanding market in which companies pay landowners to grow or conserve trees, which absorb carbon from the atmosphere, to counterbalance their own carbon emissions. For owners of smaller family tracts, selling carbon offsets or other credits would give them an alternative income to harvesting their timber or selling their property to a developer. Companies are pouring billions of dollars into environmental credits, but small landowners face daunting barriers to eligibility, said Rita Hite, president and CEO of the American Forest Foundation. To participate, owners need to take an inventory of their forested property, have a land management plan and run models to calculate the land's carbon value. “Previously, if you didn’t have 5,000 acres or more, you weren’t participating in these markets,"" Hite said. ""Not only are there technical hurdles, but also financing hurdles.” The American Forest Foundation and the Nature Conservancy launched a joint program four years ago that covers many of the costs for family land owners to sell carbon offsets for their land. Those groups and other nonprofits will be eligible to apply for grants of up to $25 million to provide direct help to landowners under the Biden administration's program. So will state forestry agencies, university agricultural extension services and others The money could pay professionals to help owners develop land management plans or to connect them with with project managers who serve as middlemen between owners and companies seeking environmental credits. The grants were welcomed by John Littles, a leader of the Sustainable Forestry and African American Land Retention Network hosting the Georgia conference. The group represents 1,600 Black landowners across eight Southern states — Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Texas and Virginia.“Most of the time, we're left out — more specifically people of color,” Littles said. “We're not afforded the opportunity to help design the programs, so the programs are mainly now designed for large landholdings and large acreage.” Littles said his network plans to apply for a grant under the new program. But he's not sure how much demand there will be from landowners. He said that will largely depend on whether owners of smaller acreages can get enough money from conservation credits. “I think it's still early to tell,"" Littles said. “But it has to be a benefit for the landowners."" Hite of the American Forest Foundation said landowners with small acreage shouldn't expect big profits from selling environmental credits. She said owners enrolled in the group's Family Forest Carbon Program earn on average about $10 per acre in a year. “Is this going to matter for a 30-acre landowner? It’s not going to make them rich,” Hite said. “But it will probably pay the taxes.”",Liberal
Daily Progress,"Environmental groups sue to keep Virginia in Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative A coalition of environmental groups filed a lawsuit Monday in Virginia that challenges Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s move to pull the state out of a regional carbon cap-and-trade initiative. The Southern Environmental Law Center filed the long-promised lawsuit in Fairfax County Circuit Court to try to keep Virginia in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, also known as RGGI, which involves power plant emissions. The lawsuit argues that Virginia's State Air Pollution Control Board and the Department of Environmental Quality lacked the authority to leave the initiative, which has been lowering Virginia's carbon footprint. “Carbon dioxide emissions from Virginia power plants have declined by 16.8 percent in the first two years of participation,” the lawsuit stated. Virginia's Air Pollution Control Board voted 4-3 in June to repeal Virginia’s participation in RGGI (pronounced “Reggie”). Virginia's Republican governor has made withdrawal from the compact a priority, citing its impact on the cost of electricity. The State Corporation Commission has estimated the typical monthly bill could increase by $2.00 to $2.50 for the years 2027 to 2030. The environmental groups argue that the board lacked the authority to withdraw from the initiative because it was the General Assembly that voted in 2020 to join the compact. DEQ declined to comment, citing the pending litigation. In a statement issued through the governor’s office, Secretary of Natural and Historic Resources Travis Voyles called RGGI a “regressive tax” that doesn’t incentivize emissions reductions. The Office of Virginia's Attorney General determined that the pollution board had the legal authority to take action, Voyles stated, “furthering Virginians access to a reliable, affordable, clean and growing supply of power."" RGGI is an effort by mid-Atlantic and Northeast states to reduce power plants’ carbon emissions through a cap-and-trade system. It requires power plants of a certain generating capacity to purchase allowances to emit carbon dioxide. The greenhouse gas contributes to global warming, which scientists say is already accelerating sea level rise and worsening extreme weather. Legislation that cleared the General Assembly in 2020 made Virginia a full participant after the state had spent years moving toward joining. Virginia was the first Southern state to join the compact. In Virginia, most proceeds from the sale of carbon allowances are divvied up between efforts to assist localities affected by recurrent flooding and sea-level rise, and a state-administered account to support energy efficiency programs for low-income individuals. Youngkin has expressed concerns over the costs of the carbon allowances, which his administration argued can be passed along to consumers, while offering no incentive to power companies to change their emissions.",Liberal
Daily Progress,"In Hawaii, concerns over ‘climate gentrification’ rise after devastating Maui fires Kim Cuevas-Reyes, a 38-year-old cellphone store owner, snuck into Lahaina earlier this month to see the remnants of her home with her own eyes. She took back roads and walked. What she saw stunned her. “When you step into the house, it’s like an inch or two of ash. There is nothing,"" she said, adding that she hopes to stay and rebuild her home and destroyed business and is in touch with the insurance company. More than 3,000 buildings in Lahaina were damaged by fire, smoke or both. Insured property losses alone already total some $3.2 billion, according to Karen Clark & Company, a prominent disaster and risk modeling firm. With a housing crisis that has priced out many Native Hawaiians as well as families that have been there for decades, concerns are rising that the state could become the latest example of “climate gentrification,” when it becomes harder for local people to afford housing in safer areas after a climate-amped disaster. It's a term Jesse Keenan, an associate professor of sustainable real estate and urban planning at Tulane University School of Architecture, first started lecturing about in 2013 after he noticed changes in housing markets following extreme weather events. Jennifer Gray Thompson is CEO of After the Fire USA, a wildfire recovery and resiliency organization in the western U.S., and worked for Sonoma County during the destructive Tubbs Fire in October 2017. Thompson said Maui is one of the “scariest opportunities for gentrification” that she’s seen because of “the very high land values and the intense level of trauma and the people who are unscrupulous who will come in to try to take advantage of that.” Thompson predicted potential developers and investors will research who has mortgages and said Maui residents should expect cold calls. “You won’t be able to go to a grocery store without a flyer attached to your car,” she said. Hawaii Gov. Josh Green said his state attorney general will draft a moratorium on the sale of damaged properties in Lahaina, to protect local landowners from being “victimized” by opportunistic buyers as Maui rebuilds. Thompson said she supports that “wholeheartedly."" But she acknowledged some people won’t be able to afford to rebuild and will want to sell their land. While one extreme weather event cannot be entirely blamed on climate change, experts say storms, fires and floods, which are becoming more damaging in a warming world, help make Hawaii one of the riskiest states in the country. Earthquakes, tsunamis and volcanoes, which are not related to climate change, also add to this risk. According to an analysis of Federal Emergency Management Agency records, there were as many federally declared disaster wildfires this month as in the 50 years between 1953 and 2003. Additionally, burned area in Hawaii increased more than fivefold since the 1980s, according to figures from the University of Hawaii Manoa. Justin Tyndall, an assistant professor at the University of Hawaii Economic Research Organization, explained that Hawaii is the most expensive state to rent or own a home in the U.S. “by a considerable margin” with a median price single family home on Maui exceeding $1 million. “Even in the condominium market on Maui, the median price is close to $900,000, so there’s really no affordable options throughout all out of the state,” he explained. Until now, when homeowners in Hawaii have considered climate change, Tyndall said, it's been coastal erosion, sea level rise and hurricanes, mainly. “Wildfire was something that was on people’s radars. … But obviously the extensive damage, most people didn’t predict,” he said. Fire needs to be taken more seriously now, he said. Maui has stringent affordable housing requirements for new multifamily construction, Tyndall said. But the practical effect has been that very little housing gets built. So new supply is low, both for affordable housing and rentals at market rate. Tyndall said the Native Hawaiian community has been hit the hardest by the housing crisis and there has been a “huge exodus” due to this lack of affordable housing. The Indigenous-led NDN Collective issued a statement supporting community-led rebuilding for Lahaina, “in ways that center the values, ancestral connections to land and water, and Indigenous knowledge systems of the kānaka ʻōiwi, Native Hawaiian people.” With wildfires, areas that don't burn become more desirable, changing cost of living considerably. The 2018 Camp Fire in Paradise, California, was an example of this as people moved down into the Central Valley to Chico where there is far less risk of wildfire, Keenan added. Other examples are New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina and various cities in Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria, where many people could not afford to come back. Not everyone finds the gentrification concept useful, though. Katharine Mach, professor at the University of Miami Rosenstiel School of Marine, Atmospheric, and Earth Science, cautioned against immediately labelling a situation climate gentrification, because that makes it difficult to tease out the other factors such as decades of discrimination, racism and land use changes. Climate change is overlaid on top of inequities in how we manage flooding or rebuild after fire, she said. “You can call that climate gentrification, but you could also say it’s inequity in how we manage disasters in the United States.”",Liberal
CNN,"As young conservatives try to get climate on the agenda in 2024, denial takes the spotlight instead During this week’s Republican primary debate on Fox News, a young voter notably asked about the climate crisis: How would these presidential candidates assuage concerns that the Republican Party “doesn’t care” about the issue? The question was all but unavoidable after weeks of extreme, deadly weather. Global temperature records have been shattered, extreme heat has soared off-the-charts in the US and the Maui wildfire death toll continues to climb. What followed the question was one of the night’s most chaotic exchanges, demonstrating the challenge some conservatives face in getting climate policy on the 2024 GOP agenda, even as extreme weather takes its toll on millions of people across the country. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, the leader of a state that has been thrashed by deadly extreme weather in recent years, refused the moderators’ show-of-hands question on whether climate change is caused by humans. He used the moment to deride the media and President Joe Biden’s response in Maui. Then 38-year-old Vivek Ramaswamy – notably the youngest candidate on stage – called the “climate change agenda” a “hoax,” an answer that elicited intense boos from the audience. A majority of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents – 55% – say human activity is causing changes to the world’s climate, according to a recent Washington Post/University of Maryland poll. It also found a majority of Americans and Republicans say their area has been impacted by extreme heat in the past five years. But connecting the dots between climate and extreme weather is proving a more partisan issue. The poll found there are deep divides between Republicans and Democrats on the question of whether human-caused climate change is contributing to extreme weather: just 35% of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents said they think climate change is a major factor in extremely hot days, compared with 85% of those who lean Democrat. After the debate, a prominent conservative climate group said Ramaswamy tried to clarify his position. “He came to our after-party and he blatantly told us that he believes climate change is real,” Benji Backer, founder of the American Conservation Coalition, told CNN. “So, he changed his position again.” Asked by CNN on Friday whether he believes climate change is real, Ramaswamy responded, “Climate change has existed as long as the Earth has existed. Manmade climate change has existed as long as man has existed on the earth.” In an email, Ramaswamy’s campaign spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin told CNN the candidate does believe climate change is real, but policies to address it “have little to do with climate change and more to do with penalizing the West as a way to achieve global ‘equity.’” Yet for Republicans working to make climate policy more mainstream in the GOP, Ramaswamy’s language at the debate echoed a climate crisis-denying candidate who wasn’t onstage, former President Donald Trump. Trump has called climate change itself a “hoax” and falsely claimed wind turbines cause cancer. “The fact that he chose the word hoax, to me, he’s emulating what President Trump had said before,” Heather Reams, president of conservative nonprofit Citizens for Responsible Energy Solutions, told CNN. Reams, who was sitting in the audience in Milwaukee, noted that Ramaswamy calling the “climate change agenda” a hoax didn’t go over well in a room full of Republicans. “The whole place booed him, so it wasn’t well received,” Reams said. “Hearing booing was actually heartening to hear that the party is really moving on, they’re seeing the economic opportunities that can be had for the United States being a leader in lowering emissions.” Ramaswamy’s response was an attempt to go after the older GOP voting base in the primary, Backer said. It’s the kind of audience that Fox News has historically played to when it hosts climate deniers on some of its shows or casts doubt on the connection between extreme weather and the climate crisis – but Backer said the fact the network even asked this question “just shows that the pendulum is shifting.” Backer warned Ramasway’s response to the question risks alienating younger conservative voters who are increasingly concerned about climate impacts. “I’ve in two presidential elections and I’ve never voted for a Republican president in my life, because I don’t vote for climate deniers,” Backer said, adding that climate denial “is the way of the past.” Several Republican presidential candidates have said they believe climate change is real and caused by human activity – a shift from previous elections. Former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley acknowledged its reality but said foreign nations, including India and China, bear larger responsibility for addressing it. Haley, South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum have all engaged frequently with conservative groups, Reams and Backer said. “I think that Nikki Haley provided a very clear, very positive response,” Danielle Butcher Franz, CEO of the American Conservation Coalition, told CNN. “We need to see more responses like that in the Republican Party. I think it’s important that we show the conservative environmental movement is here to stay.” Backer warned that Ramaswamy and other candidates risk losing young voters if they continue to engage in climate denial – or anything that sounds remotely like it. “There’s a lot of Republicans leading on this, but the narrative is that we don’t care,” Backer said. “And if we nominate another person who doesn’t care, young people are not going to forget that. There’s not going to be a lot of baby boomers in 20 years, so you better start thinking about the next generation.”",Liberal
CNN,"Parts of tropical rainforests could get too hot for photosynthesis, study suggests Some leaves in tropical forests from South America to South East Asia are getting so hot they may no longer be able to photosynthesize, with big potential consequences for the world’s forests, according to a new study. Leaves’ ability to photosynthesize – the process by which they make energy from carbon dioxide, sunlight and water – begins to fail when their temperature reaches around 46.7 degrees Celsius (116 Fahrenheit). While this may seem high, leaves can get much hotter than the air temperature, according to the report published Wednesday in Nature by a group of scientists from countries including the US, Australia and Brazil. The scientists used temperature data beamed down from thermal satellite sensors on the International Space Station, 400 kilometers (nearly 250 miles) above the Earth. They combined this with on-the-ground observations from leaf-warming experiments, in which scientists climbed into the canopy to painstakingly add sensors to leaves. Rather than looking at average temperatures, the scientists were looking at extremes, said Christopher Doughty, associate professor in ecoinformatics at Northern Arizona University and a report author. They found that average forest canopy temperatures peaked at 34 degrees Celsius (93 Fahrenheit) but some exceeded 40 degrees Celsius (104 Fahrenheit). Currently, 0.01% of leaves are passing the critical temperature threshold beyond which their ability to photosynthesize breaks down, the report found, potentially killing the leaf and the tree. This percentage, while small, is poised to increase as the world warms, the report said, posing a threat to the world’s tropical forests – which cover roughly 12% of the planet and hold more than half of the world’s species. They also provide a vital role in sucking up and storing carbon and helping to regulate the global climate.“There are all sorts of potential feedbacks once you start losing bits of forests, even leaves on individual trees,” Doughty said on a call with reporters. Tropical forests can withstand around 4 degrees Celsius (7.2 Fahrenheit) of additional global warming before they reach a tipping point in terms of their ability to photosynthesize, according to the report. If warming exceeds this level, the amount of leaves surpassing critical temperature thresholds could rise to 1.4%, potentially causing large-scale leaf loss and the death of the whole tree, the report found. This level of warming is not expected under current climate policies, which are estimated to bring 2.7 degrees Celsius of warming above pre-industrial levels. But it is within the range of the most pessimistic climate scenarios if the world continues to burn fossil fuels. While these figures may seem small, the risk is significant given how critical tropical trees are for life, the climate system and the planet. “Almost all life – including humans – is dependent on photosynthesis for food either directly or indirectly,” said Kevin Collins, senior lecturer in environment and systems at the Open University, who was not involved in the research. The findings indicate that global warming is putting this vital process at risk, he told the Science Media Centre. But, he added, there are more immediate concerns for tropical forests, including deforestation, wildfires and droughts. Christopher Still, a forest ecosystem professor at Oregon State University, also not involved in the report, said that the research provided some novel insights. While there’s been a big focus on the impact of drought on tree loss, he told CNN, “this paper says it’s not just drought – we need to really also worry about the temperatures that leaves are reaching.” While he acknowledged the numbers in the report are small, he added, “I would focus a little bit less on the percentages, and more on the concepts of leaves pushing up against these really high temperature conditions and how often that happens, how long it lasts and what it really means.” Others were more cautious. Chloe Brimicombe, a climate scientist at the University of Graz in Austria, said that given how few leaves are reaching the critical temperature threshold, and how high warming would need to get before a tipping point, “this suggests in theory tropical forests are quite resilient to climate change.” She told the Science Media Centre, “this is a simple model and trees and forest dynamics are much more complex than this.” The report authors said despite uncertainties, the research gives important insights around how tropical forests will respond to climate change. “It’s a little bit of a canary in the coal mine that we’re starting to see,” Joshua Fisher, a climate scientist at Chapman University and a report author, said on a call with reporters. “And you want to be able to detect something happening before it’s widespread.”",Liberal
CNN,"Weather that drove eastern Canada’s devastating wildfires made twice as likely by climate change The weather conditions that fueled record-shattering wildfires in eastern Canada earlier this summer – and sent plumes of hazardous air into the US – were made more likely and more intense by the climate crisis, according to a new report published Tuesday. Scientists from the World Weather Attribution initiative – which calculates the role of climate change in extreme weather events – found human-caused climate change more than doubled the likelihood of hot, dry and windy conditions that drove the Quebec fires between May and July, and made this fire-prone weather at least 20% more intense. The severity of Quebec’s fire season up to the end of July was also made 50% more intense by climate change, according to the report. Climate change’s impact may be much greater than the study’s figures show, said Friederike Otto, co-founder of WWA and senior lecturer at the Grantham Institute in the UK, who added that the report had used the most conservative estimates. Wildfires are complex to study because of the tangle of factors that influence them, but scientists say climate change, driven by the burning of fossil fuels, is loading the dice in favor of more devastating fires.“It’s becoming evident that the dry and warm conditions conducive to wildfires are becoming more common and more intense around the world as a result of climate change,” said Clair Barnes, a research associate at the Grantham Institute and a report author. Canada has experienced an unprecedented fire season this year, amid hot and dry conditions. May to June was the warmest such two-month period in Canada since records began in 1940, breaking the previous record by a substantial margin – 0.8 degrees Celsius (1.4 Fahrenheit). More than 15 million hectares (over 37 million acres) across the country have been scorched – an area about the size of Illinois. The fires have killed at least 17 people and forced the evacuations of more than 150,000. Quebec has been particularly affected, with the most area burned of any Canadian province. Wildfires have devastated 5.2 million hectares (12.8 million acres) there so far, about 26 times the average amount burned by late August. The fires have also caused dangerous levels of air pollution in Canada and across swaths of the US, leading to school closures in both countries and a spike in asthma-related hospital visits. Smoke from the fires even made it to Western Europe. It is by far the worst wildfire season Canada has ever experienced, and there are still more than two months left to go. To understand the role of climate change in the fires, the WWA scientists looked at “fire weather” – including high temperatures, strong winds and dry conditions, all of which help fires ignite, spread and intensify. The scientists used data from the Fire Weather Index – a measure of fire danger – to gauge the persistence of extreme fire conditions as well as the severity of the fire season overall. They then used climate models to understand the role climate change played. They concluded that a wildfire season as severe as the one Quebec experienced up to the end of July was at least seven times more likely to occur because of climate change, and that human-induced warming made Quebec’s total fire weather season at least 50% more intense. Climate change also made the peak fire weather in Quebec during the same period at least twice as likely and 20% more intense, according to the report. While Quebec’s fires were unprecedented, the report authors wrote, “they are no longer extremely unusual.” In today’s climate, which is around 1.2 degrees Celsius warmer than preindustrial times, similar weather conditions can be expected once every 25 years, the report found.Around 1,000 fires continue to rage across Canada, with 200 of them burning in the Northwest Territories, where thousands of people were evacuated Friday from the capital Yellowknife. About 35,000 people are under evacuation orders in British Columbia. Kira Hoffman, a fire ecologist at the University of British Columbia and the Bulkley Valley Research Centre, who was not involved in the report, said there are many factors that contribute to extreme wildfire seasons, including logging, large-scale clearouts and abandoning Indigenous fire stewardship techniques. But all these factors interact with the climate crisis, she told CNN. “A rapidly changing climate is creating longer, drier and hotter wildfire seasons across Canada,” Hoffman said. One of the major concerns with increasingly intense fire behavior is the impact on wildfire management, said Michael Flannigan, BC research chair for Predictive Services, Emergency Management and Fire Science at Thompson Rivers University.“If we see more days above fire intensity thresholds, we will see more escape fires, more area burned and more impacts to society,” he told CNN. “Until we stop burning fossil fuels,” said Otto in a statement, “the number of wildfires will continue to increase, burning larger areas for longer periods of time.”",Liberal
CNN,"In Maui and across America, climate change and extreme weather are hurting housing affordability Three weeks before wildfires ravaged Maui, killing more than 100 people and displacing thousands, Hawaii’s governor, Josh Green, had warned of a different emergency: an acute housing crisis. Now Maui starts down the long process of rebuilding the more than 2,000 homes and businesses lost. Much of the devastating damage was to the homes and business where Maui’s working class lived and worked. Many find themselves now caught in both a housing crisis and a climate emergency. Hannah Harris, a physician assistant in the Maui town of Lahaina, and her boyfriend, Tony Ellett, a general manager at a local bar and grill, lost their home to the flames. “The fire came up so fast,” said Harris. “We only had five minutes to get out.” Harris and Ellett just moved into their apartment in May. The couple had jumped at the chance to live in a place with below-market rent that was set aside for local workers. They traded one three-bedroom apartment for another and saw their rent drop from $5,800 a month to $3,800. They are staying with friends now and looking for a new apartment but finding the rents people are asking have gone up since they were looking in the spring. “There was a shortage of housing even before the fire,” said Shantal Catanach, an artist and musician in Lahaina. Catanach and her 3-year-old son Keanu had just moved into a two-bedroom apartment in a newly built 89-unit income-restricted rental building. It too was destroyed. “This is why they have been building these affordable housing buildings. To get people like me and other working families to stay.” Catanach lost several instruments and DJ equipment as well as more than 30 of her paintings in the fire. Now she’s staying in another part of the island with friends, where she said there were already seven roommates before she arrived. She is grateful that she and her son were able to escape the fire and happy to have a place to stay, for now. “You don’t want to overstay your welcome,” she said. “But you’re in a tough spot financially. You feel insecure. It is a safe place, but it doesn’t feel like home.” Affordable housing picture on Maui was already ‘pretty grim’ For people on Maui and across the US, climate change is making the affordable housing crunch even worse. In many cases, Americans have sought affordable homes in areas that are in greater risk of hurricanes, floods, extreme heat and wildfires, according to a report from the Urban Institute. A human-caused climate crisis has exacerbated the hot and dry conditions that allow wildfires to ignite and grow in many parts of the planet, according to a UN Environment Programme report. This has primed vulnerable areas for devastating results. While it is difficult to link the Maui fires to the climate crisis without a thorough analysis, scientists say conditions there are consistent with trends that are known as climate changes. Specifically, parts of Maui were in a severe drought that left vegetation dried out, potentially providing fuel for wildfires. “What has happened to Maui is that because of climate change we have become a drier climate,” said Stan Franco, a board member of Stand Up Maui, a housing advocacy group. “We have had fires before. Grass fires. But not fires damaging buildings and taking lives.” “The affordable housing picture was pretty grim on Maui even before the fire,” he said. The disaster “adds more pain for our people as far as housing is concerned.” In Maui County, more than half of renters are considered rent burdened and pay over 30% of their income toward rent, a standard affordability threshold, according to a housing report released last month from University of Hawaii’s Economic Research Organization. The report found Maui County had the highest share in the state of those who are severely cost burdened, or pay over half their income toward rent. The median price of a home on Maui is over $1 million. The typical household needs to earn $252,000 a year to afford to buy a house in Hawaii, according to the governor’s office. Many of the Maui residents impacted by the fire work in tourism and service jobs, which do not approach those salaries. A typical nurse earns $113,000 a year in Hawaii, while a hotel desk worker earns $52,430 and a food preparation worker earns $37,580, according to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics. “The people who live here work in the hotel industry,” said Franco. “They are taking two or three jobs. They are living with relatives. They were making do. The fire has created much more of a problem.” Even before the fire, fewer than 1 in 3 Maui households could afford a single family home, according to the governor’s office. The housing emergency declaration by the governor before the fire had introduced a new process to help build quality homes faster. But now it’s much more complicated on Maui. And in the meantime, displaced residents need somewhere to live. Climate challenges worsening housing woes Over 14.5 million homes in the US were affected by natural disasters in 2021, according to a report from Corelogic, a real estate data company, amounting to an estimated $57 billion in damage. That included about 4,000 homes impacted by wildfire, 560,000 homes impacted by severe weather like tornadoes and hail, more than a million homes impacted by hurricanes and over 12 million homes that were impacted by winter storms causing water damage and burst pipes. These extreme weather events are increasing. By the beginning of August – before the fire in Maui – there had already been 15 confirmed weather or climate disaster that had losses over $1 billion each in the US this year, according to the NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information. Between 1980 and 2022 the average number of events of that magnitude each year was eight. The annual average over the past five years has risen to 18. This is putting more people at greater risk, including 60 million homes in areas that could expect at least moderate losses, according to a report from the Joint Center for Housing Studies at Harvard University. “When disasters strike, the lowest-income and most marginalized survivors are often hardest hit,” said Diane Yentel, the president and CEO of the National Low Income Housing Coalition, a membership organization focused on affordable housing. “They have the fewest resources and face the longest, steepest path to recovery.” That can lead people to live in uninhabitable homes, sleep in cars, double- or triple-up with other low-income families or pay more than half of their incomes on rent, which puts them at increased risk of displacement, eviction, and homelessness, she said. The current federal disaster recovery system was designed for the middle class. “It is a system that never contemplated, and so it does not address, the unique needs of the lowest-income and most marginalized people,” Yentel said. Some survivors may have language barriers or lack the ability to produce necessary documents quickly. Some are among the 5.9 million households that don’t have a bank or credit union account, according to an estimate from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. At times, she said, the aid can exacerbate many of the challenges people struggling for housing faced prior to the storm. During recovery, she said, resources devoted to homelessness can be stretched to account for many more people who are temporarily homeless. In such cases, it makes it harder for communities to provide for the pre-disaster population experiencing housing instability. Natural disasters also exacerbate the existing rental housing crisis for households with the lowest incomes, Yentel said. “After Hurricane Sandy [in 2012], for example, households already dealing with housing instability were further destabilized through displacement and increased rents,” she said. “Two years after Sandy, few new affordable homes had been completed, yet survivors were no longer eligible for federal rental assistance.” Maui can expect to face a long timeline for rebuilding, and at much greater costs. High rebuilding costs expected to hamper affordability Hawaii’s high land and construction costs and lengthy approval process make it hard to build affordable housing there, said Peter Niess, owner of Maui Architectural Group. Many homes destroyed in the Lahaina fire were older homes that had been remodeled and expanded over many years to accommodate multi-family living due to high housing costs, according to Niess. “Even if they build back the allowable portion of their property, it will displace people in the long term,” he said. “There was more than one kitchen, more than one family living there.” These types of cobbled-together solutions to affordable housing are now gone, as are other recent hard-won affordable housing projects. “We were a part of a workforce housing project that burned down,” said Niess. “It is such a long process to get through the entitlement procedures with the county and the state.” And while rebuilding is an opportunity to keep climate concerns in mind, that usually increases costs. “You can’t have a more solid bulletproof, code-compliant home and a more affordable home at the same time,” said Niess. “Not unless someone subsidizes that substantially.”",Liberal
CNN,"Biden’s climate law has led to 86,000 new jobs and $132 billion in investment, new report says A year after Democrats passed their sweeping $750 billion climate and health care law, it’s leading to a surge of clean energy projects and job creation, according to a recent Bank of America report. More than 270 new clean energy projects have been announced since the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), with private investments totaling $132 billion, according to the report. These investments are expected to be accompanied by more than 86,000 jobs, including 50,000 jobs related to electric vehicles. The Inflation Reduction Act “is not only working to strengthen supply chains but also to boost domestic manufacturing and create new jobs,” Bank of America said in the report. The White House is attempting to keep focus on the one-year anniversary of the lnflation Reduction Act’s passage this week with an assortment of senior officials traveling across the country to mark the occasion – selling the bill to voters, a White House official says. A recent poll found most voters still don’t know what’s in the law. The nearly $370 billion clean energy and climate package, which passed on a party-line vote, was the largest climate investment in US history. Its goal is to reduce carbon emissions by 40% by 2030. Inflation has cooled over the past year, but it doesn’t have much to do with the law. The bill contained many tax incentives meant to bring down the cost of electricity with more renewables, and spur more consumers to switch to clean electricity to power their homes and vehicles. Close to half of private investment went to EVs and battery production, while the rest went to renewable energy like solar, wind and nuclear projects, grid investments, and other projects, according to Bank of America. The law is driving the most clean energy job growth in Georgia, South Carolina, Nevada and Tennessee. The Inflation Reduction Act’s “impact is becoming more evident,” Bank of America said. The law is expected to “play a vital role in incentivizing investments and creating jobs” in 2024 and 2025, too. White House touts law President Joe Biden is traveling to a clean energy manufacturing company in Wisconsin Tuesday and holding an event celebrating the anniversary back at the White House Wednesday. It comes after a Washington Post-UMD poll out last week found 71% of Americans have heard “little” or “nothing at all” about the legislation one year after its enactment. Last week, Biden lamented the choice of the law’s name. “The Inflation Reduction Act – I wish I hadn’t called it that, because it has less to do with reducing inflation than it does to do with dealing with providing for alternatives that generate economic growth,” he told donors, according to a transcript provided by the White House.",Liberal
CNN,"Biden administration to invest $1.2 billion in projects to suck carbon out of the air The Biden administration on Friday announced its first major investment to kickstart the US carbon removal industry – something energy experts say is key to getting the country’s planet-warming emissions under control. Direct air capture removal projects are akin to huge vacuum cleaners sucking carbon dioxide out of the air, using chemicals to remove the greenhouse gas. Once removed, CO2 gets stored underground, or is used in industrial materials like cement. On Friday, the US Department of Energy announced it is spending $1.2 billion to fund two new demonstration projects in Texas and Louisiana – the South Texas Direct Air Capture hub and Project Cypress in Louisiana. “These two projects are going to build these regional direct air capture hubs,” US Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm told reporters. “That means they’re going to link everything from capture to processing to deep underground storage, all in one seamless process.” Granholm said the projects are expected to remove more than 2 million metric tons of carbon dioxide from the air annually once they are up and running – the equivalent of removing nearly 500,000 gas cars off the road. The machines are being built to essentially supercharge the natural carbon removal already done by trees, bogs and oceans – which is not happening fast enough to capture fossil fuel emissions at the scale humans are emitting them. White House senior adviser Mitch Landrieu told reporters these will be the first direct air capture projects at this scale in the US and “will be the largest in the world.” Another project in Iceland that opened in 2021 removes about 10 metric tons of CO2 every day, roughly the same amount of carbon emitted by 800 cars a day. At the time, that project’s operator Climeworks said it was the largest one in the world. The US direct air capture projects alone could increase global capacity for the technology by 400 times, said Sasha Stashwick, policy director at Carbon180 – an independent nonprofit focused on carbon removal. “The industry’s very nascent at the moment,” Stashwick told CNN. “These are meant to be the first commercial-scale deployments at the mega-ton scale. It’s a very, very big deal.” Though it’s not yet clear what the hubs will ultimately do with the carbon once its extracted, Department of Energy officials said neither hub will use captured CO2 for enhanced oil recovery – a method where carbon is injected into the ground to release more oil. Stashwick said it’s important this is followed, and that Carbon180 has been advocating for carbon to be safely and permanently stored underground or used in building materials like cement. “We think it’s really critical for public acceptance,” Stashwick said. “This is really the debut of the direct air capture industry in the US. It’s going to be many people’s first introduction to technological carbon removal.” Another issue is how hubs are powered to ensure carbon removal isn’t adding more emissions to the atmosphere. Representatives from Battelle, the owner of the Louisiana project, said they would be powering the hub with clean energy bought from the local utility, but have plans to power facilities with renewable energy in the future.",Liberal

The Onion,"Optimistic Researchers Say There Still Time To Head Off Climate Change Before It Starts Killing Rich People. In a rare silver lining amid increasingly dire assessments of the climate crisis, optimistic researchers at the University of California, Berkeley, released a report Friday suggesting there was still time to head off environmental catastrophe before it started killing rich people. “Though rising sea levels and powerful storms are devastating coastal areas, it’s not too late to stop floods from threatening those who live high above the water in multimillion-dollar penthouses,” said climatologist and report author Dennis Gibson, explaining that by 2030, the wealthiest 0.01% of Americans would need to increase investment in charter helicopter services to ensure they would have a way to travel from a metropolitan high-rise to a vacation home without inconvenience. “Similarly, rich people’s ski chalets in Wyoming, Vermont, and the Alps are at elevations that provide them with natural protection against flooding rivers. In the case of wildfires, however, they must act now if they wish to save their mountain retreats, mansions in wine country, and various other country estates.

The Onion,"U.S. Unveils Plan For Rest Of World To Become Carbon-Neutral By 2030. Touting the measure as the most ambitious effort ever to tackle climate change on a global level, the United States unveiled a plan Monday for the rest of the world to become carbon-neutral by 2030. “Climate change is a serious threat to American livelihoods, which is why we have taken the unprecedented step of announcing that every single other country besides the United States will reduce their carbon emissions to zero over the next 10 years,” said Secretary of State Mike Pompeo at a press conference unveiling the Washington Climate Agreement, which had 194 forced signatories representing every other country in the world. “As the world’s superpower, we know that it is incumbent on us to lead the way in the effort to fight global warming, and it’s why we will stop at nothing to ensure that every country besides America ends its dependence on fossil fuels. We commend our ambitious goals for other countries—France, for instance, is going carbon-neutral by 2022, and we’re especially gratified to see that China, under the terms of this agreement, will involuntarily offset all of America’s carbon emissions, which will be able to go up dramatically under this agreement. The Washington pact shows that if we Americans put our mind to it, there’s nothing we can’t compel other countries to do.” U.S. officials added that the plan would likely cause significant issues and economic hardship in emerging economies, but under the terms of the agreement, they didn’t care.",Liberal
The Onion,"Overwhelmed Archaeologists Struggling To Keep Pace With Glut Of Early Humans Thawed Out By Climate Change. Noting that the steady rise in global temperatures was beginning to have a significant impact on their work, anthropologists at Oxford University told reporters Tuesday that they were struggling to keep up with the abundance of early human remains being thawed out due to climate change. “It seems like every other day a hunter in North Canada or some unsuspecting hikers in Siberia are stumbling across the perfectly preserved remains of a 2,000-year-old human ancestor emerging from melting glaciers or receding permafrost; we can barely keep up,” said lead researcher Adam Daly, adding that as climate change has become more severe, his team has had to take drastic measures to fast-track some of their processes, such as performing CT scans on more than one mummified carcass at once and skipping hair analysis altogether. “We don’t even get excited anymore about anything potentially groundbreaking because it just means more work for us. Any satchels of prehistoric tools are just thrown into a drawer now; we have something like a hundred ancient hammerstones we’re never going to get around to analyzing. We even stopped giving the earliest human ancestors we find names.

The Onion,"Critics In 2030s Ask Why Teen Climate Activist Isn’t In Abandoned School Bailing Water And Shooting Enemy Foragers. In response to the attention she was receiving for her vocal objections to international leaders’ refusal to address global warming, critics in the 2030s asked why teen climate activist Elisa Garcia-Reilly wasn’t in an abandoned school bailing water and shooting enemy foragers. “Instead of constantly screeching about how all our policies are selling out her generation and dooming them to unavoidable suffering, maybe this little hussy ought to spend more time in the remains of what was once a high school choosing which infants to save and defending her family’s food cache from scavengers,” said television pundit Caden Williams of the 16-year-old climate activist, voicing the sentiments of critics who declared that she had no clue what she was talking about and was trying to catastrophize being constantly starving and up to her waist in water. “All these teenagers getting riled up about climate change need to settle down and stay home to help the rest of their wandering band butcher enough giant cockroach meat to feed everyone.

Explaining that their recent findings indicated that climate change would have some positive effects on the environment, encouraged marine biologists at the University of Rhode Island projected Tuesday that the planet’s oceans will be a nice, simmering seafood bisque by 2040. “Within the next 20 years or so, we expect that global temperatures will have increased to the point that the majority of the ocean will be a delicious, hearty broth filled with perfectly cooked chunks of octopus, crab, and dolphin,” said marine biologist Carol Degner, adding that as long as humanity continues to warm the Earth at its current rate, people would be able to run down to almost any coastline on the planet with a ladle and a warm crust of garlic bread to dine on the bubbling, creamy dish. “Obviously, the soup’s contents will vary by geography—we’ll be seeing more swordfish and king mackerel in the Atlantic soup, lots of angel sharks and halibut in the Pacific soup, and some delicacies like slow-cooked walrus from the Arctic soup region. We suggest preparing for it by commandeering boats to travel out into the ocean now and start sprinkling in red pepper flakes or cajun seasoning so that by 2040, the ocean really hits the spot. The only real downside is that humanity may quickly deplete the planet’s supply of bread bowls.” The marine biologists did warn, however, that if the soup ends up being too good, it could lead to sea levels dropping precipitously.",Liberal

The good news, however, is that in the five minutes directly after losing a loved one in a hurricane, participants were much more likely to consider reducing their carbon footprint by taking public transit rather than driving.” The report estimated that the nation would have to suffer 34,000 consecutive natural disasters this month in order to garner significant support for climate change legislation.",Liberal

CNN,"Extreme heat is the deadliest natural disaster. FEMA can’t treat it like one Extreme heat is far deadlier than other natural disasters, killing on average more than twice as many people each year as hurricanes and tornadoes combined, according to data tracked by the National Weather Service. Despite this, heat isn’t on the list of disasters eligible for assistance from the Federal Emergency Management Agency because it’s nowhere in the Stafford Act – the federal law that gives FEMA the power to respond to emergencies and determines what qualifies as one. As President Joe Biden travels West this week to celebrate the Inflation Reduction Act, Democrats’ landmark climate law, and tout his climate agenda, temperatures in the Southwest are still topping out above 100 degrees. Phoenix clocked its 44th consecutive day over 105 degrees on Monday, and the extreme heat has wilted the Southwest’s iconic saguaro cactuses and given third-degree burns to people who fell on the sidewalk. Phoenix Mayor Kate Gallego recently told Biden the city’s extreme heat is a “long-term emergency.” But it can’t get FEMA federal assistance unless Congress amends the Stafford Act – something some Western lawmakers are pushing for. “We essentially just don’t have the governance structures in place to deal with heat” in the same way we deal with wildfires and hurricanes, University of Arizona professor and heat response expert Ladd Keith told CNN. “Heat is literally the fingerprint of climate change, but it’s the last part of climate we’ve begun to address at the national, state and local level.” FEMA isn’t ignoring extreme heat; the agency has programs to raise heat awareness and has emergency preparedness funding that can go towards helping mitigate heat. FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell recently told the Washington Post that the agency has a role to play in giving communities funding to set up new cooling centers or ensure power infrastructure won’t fail during high temperatures. “Just because we don’t necessarily have the authorities right now in the Stafford Act, that doesn’t mean we’re sitting idly by,” Criswell said. But the agency’s full power and resources that are set in motion when presidents declare disasters don’t apply during a heatwave – no matter how long it lasts. “Right now, FEMA doesn’t treat extreme heat in the same way as it does other disasters because it can’t,” Juanita Constible, senior climate and health advocate for the Natural Resources Defense Council, told CNN. Gallego told CNN on Tuesday that adding heat to the Stafford Act would enable Phoenix and other communities to unlock far more federal resources to help cool people and protect the electric grid when extreme heat refuses to quit. For instance, it could enable the federal government to bring in more mobile cooling units, she said. “We only have so many of them and if the fed government had a critical mass of those units they could bring them wherever they are and really help communities,” Gallego said. “We know that climate change is a reality for the entire country. We’ve seen communities from Chicago to the Pacific Northwest lose hundreds of people during heatwaves.” There is currently a bipartisan bill – led by Democratic Rep. Ruben Gallego of Arizona – to add extreme heat to the Stafford Act. But the legislation hasn’t gotten far in Congress. Rep. Gallego said in a statement he had spoken to Biden during the president’s visit to Arizona on Monday night “about the need for FEMA to declare extreme heat a disaster.” Heat is a “largely invisible threat,” Keith said, but Congress adding it to the Stafford Act could be a tremendous boost to state and federal efforts to combat its effects. For instance, if power goes out in a community that is sweltering in a heatwave, federal officials could more easily step in to provide cooling, Keith said. “Adding it to that official list from Congress would clarify FEMA’s role in addressing heat,” Keith said. But Constible told CNN that despite FEMA’s vast federal resources, it actually might not be the best agency to respond to extreme heat. For one thing, heat is a “creeping disaster;” unlike a hurricane or tornado, it lingers, instead of rolling in and out of a place quickly. And heat takes a toll on humans more than it does on infrastructure. “Disasters tend to be defined in terms of property damage,” Constible said. “Very expensive things get broken and that’s when a disaster gets declared. But heat is more of a health problem.” There are already 39 confirmed heat-associated deaths so far this year in Maricopa County, where Phoenix is located – and over 300 more are under investigation – according to county data. “We don’t have a good way of even capturing how many people are unwell in a particular heatwave,” Constible said. “I would argue the entire nation is unprepared for the temperatures we’re seeing this summer.” To address the void, the Biden administration has announced several federal initiatives to try to deal with the heat. At a recent event where he heard from the Phoenix and San Antonio mayors, Biden announced he was asking the Department of Labor to ramp up its enforcement efforts to protect workers against the extreme heat on the job, as well as new funding to help the National Weather Service improve forecasting. “This is the most heat focused administration in our country’s history,” Keith said, noting that even a few years ago, heat was rarely listed among serious climate impacts. “Having said that, there’s still a very long way to go. It’s a very urgent issue, we need to create those government structures quickly.”",Liberal
CNN,"100-degree days are becoming more common in the cities where most people live. These charts explain why. Hot summer days in the United States have only been getting hotter. In the 25 largest US cities, days with highs breaking the 100-degree Fahrenheit barrier have become more common over the past 75 years, according to airport weather station data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. This year is no exception. Looking at the first seven months of each year, 2023 had the sixth-highest number of triple-digit highs in the 25 largest cities with available data since 1948, according to NOAA. Last year had the most days over 100 degrees Fahrenheit through the end of July in 75 years. Experts told CNN the climate crisis is intensifying heat waves and pushing days that would normally top out in the upper-90s into the triple-digits. As the number of days with extreme heat become more common, that puts an increasing strain both on individuals – especially those who work outside or don’t have access to adequate shelter – and a city’s infrastructure. “The climate has already changed. We’ve had increases in greenhouse gases for the past 150 years or more,” said David Easterling, chief of the Climate Assessments Section at NOAA’s National Centers for Environmental Information. “And what that translates to is that whether in Phoenix or Las Vegas, it’s just getting warmer there.” Overall, people living in the 25 largest cities have put up with an average of three more annual days over 100 degrees over the past 20 years than between 1948 and 1980. The average number of triple-digit temperature days have become more frequent between those two periods in 17 of the 25 largest US cities with available data, according to NOAA. Exactly how much more frequent triple-digit heat days have become varies widely across the country. Portland, Oregon, is seeing an additional day each year on average above 100 degrees since 2003 than it did between 1948 and 1980. Phoenix, on the other hand, is averaging 18 more triple-digit heat days between those same two periods. The number of triple-digit days has risen the most for a handful of cities in the Southwest and South. Residents of Phoenix, Austin, El Paso and San Antonio have seen especially startling temperature changes over the past 20 years. Between 1948 and 1980, there were 11 years when San Antonio didn’t see a single day above 100 degrees. Since 2003, though, the city has gone only one year without a day in the triple-digits. In Phoenix, a year with under 90 days with temperatures above 100 degrees used to be fairly common – it happened in 16 of the years before 1980. That’s no longer the case. The last time the city saw fewer than 90 days in the 100s was in 1998. There are always going to be local differences – the number of days over 100 degrees haven’t increased as much in Las Vegas as they have in Phoenix, Austin, El Paso or San Antonio, for example. But generally, temperatures go up significantly in areas where the soil and air are dry, Easterling said. Air moisture, or humidity, regulates temperatures and prevents it from spiking to extreme levels. Phoenix, which is located in the Sonoran Desert, runs so hot in part because of its dry climate – it has averaged just 7.22 inches of rain per year since 1948, according to Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport weather station data. That’s less than an inch per month. But while humidity may moderate the air temperature, it can also make hot temperatures feel even hotter and put more pressure on the body, which struggles to cool itself in humid weather. “It’s important for people to remember that impacts on people and infrastructure don’t start at 100 degrees,” said James Doss-Gollin, an assistant professor at Rice University’s Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering. “Things like humidity and air quality can have a big impact on how our bodies feel heat.” Even relatively small increases in the number of days of triple-digit temperatures can have a dramatic effect on a population. Seattle’s Sea-Tac International Airport, for instance, recorded the lowest average number of days above 100 degrees out of any of the 25 largest cities over both 1948-1980 and since 2003. Between 1948 and 1980, not a single day broke 100 degrees. Then the airport registered three triple-digit days in 2021 alone. “Urban areas really have to start taking this seriously and begin to say, ‘How can we create a cooler environment?’” Easterling said. “Because we’re going to see temperatures increase as we continue to increase greenhouse gas. It’s a big issue.”",Liberal
CNN,"Why Republicans can’t get out of their climate bind, even as extreme heat overwhelms the US Deadly heatwaves are baking the US. Scientists just reported that July will be the hottest month on record. And now, after years of skepticism and denial in the GOP ranks, a small number of Republicans are urging their party to get proactive on the climate crisis. But the GOP is stuck in a climate bind – and likely will be for the next four years, in large part because they’re still living in the shadow of former president and 2024 Republican frontrunner Donald Trump. Even as more Republican politicians are joining the consensus that climate change is real and caused by humans, Trump’s inflammatory rhetoric has driven the party to the right on climate and extreme weather. Trump has called the extremely settled science of climate change a “hoax” and more recently suggested that the impacts of it “may affect us in 300 years.” Scientists this week reported that this summer’s unrelenting heat wave would have been “virtually impossible” were it not for the planet-warming pollution from burning fossil fuels. They also confirmed that July will go down as the hottest month on record – and almost certainly that the planet’s temperature is hotter now than it has been in around 120,000 years. Yet for being one of the most pressing issues of the 21st century, climate is rarely mentioned on the 2024 campaign trail. “As Donald Trump is the near presumptive nominee of our party in 2024, it’s going to be very hard for a party to adopt a climate-sensitive policy,” Sen. Mitt Romney, a Republican from Utah, told CNN. “But Donald Trump’s not going to be around forever.” When Republicans do weigh in on climate change – and what we should do about it – they tend to support the idea of capturing planet-warming pollution rather than cutting fossil fuels. But many are reticent to talk about how to solve the problem, and worry Trump is having a chilling effect on policies to combat climate within the party. “We need to be talking about this,” Rep. John Curtis, a Republican from Utah and chair of the House’s Conservative Climate Caucus, told CNN. “And part of it for Republicans is when you don’t talk about it, you have no ideas at the table; all you’re doing is saying what you don’t like. We need to be saying what we like.” Extreme weather changes GOP minds With a few exceptions, Republicans largely are no longer the party of full-on climate change denial. But even as temperatures rise to deadly highs, the GOP is also not actively addressing it. There is still no “robust discussion about how to solve it” within the party, said former South Carolina Rep. Bob Inglis, who now runs the conservative climate group RepublicEn, save for criticism of Democrats’ clean-energy initiatives. “The good news is Republicans are stopping arguing with thermometers,” Inglis told CNN. Still, he said, “when the experience is multiplied over and over of multiple days of three-digit temperatures in Arizona and record ocean temperatures, people start to say, ‘this is sort of goofy we’re not doing something about this.’” Meanwhile, the impacts of a dramatically warming atmosphere are becoming more and more apparent each year. Romney and Curtis, two of the loudest climate voices in the party, both represent Utah – a state that’s no stranger to extreme heat and drought, which scientists say is being fueled by rising global temperatures. “There are a number of states, like mine, that are concerned about wildfires and water,” Romney said, adding he believes Republican governors of impacted states have been vocal about these issues. Utah and other Western states are looking for ways to cut water use to save the West’s shrinking two largest reservoirs, Lakes Powell and Mead. And even closer to home, Utah’s Great Salt Lake has already disappeared by two-thirds, and scientists are sounding alarms about a rapid continued decline that could kill delicate ecosystems and expose one of fastest-growing metropolitan areas in the nation to toxic dust. “I think the evidence so far is that the West is getting drier and hotter,” Romney told CNN. “That means that we’re going to have more difficulty with our crops, we’re going to have a harder time keeping the rivers full of water. The Great Salt Lake is probably going to continue to shrink. And unfortunately, we’re going to see more catastrophic fires. If the trends continue, we need to act.” An issue ‘held hostage’ While Republicans blast Democrats’ clean energy policies ahead of the 2024 elections, it’s less clear what the GOP itself would prefer to do about the climate crisis. As Curtis tells it, there’s a lot that Republicans and Democrats in Congress agree on. They both want to further reform the permitting process for major energy projects, and they largely agree on the need for more renewable and nuclear energy. As the head of the largest GOP climate caucus on the Hill, Curtis’ Utah home is “full solar,” he told CNN, and is heated using geothermal energy. While at a recent event at a natural gas drilling site in Ohio, as smoke from Canada’s devastating wildfire season hung thick in the air, House Speaker Kevin McCarthy was asked how he would solve the climate crisis. He suggested planting a trillion trees to help offset the pollution created by burning fossil fuels – a bill House Republicans introduced in 2020. The measure has not yet passed the House and has an uncertain future in the Senate. But the biggest and most enduring difference between the two parties is that Republicans want fossil fuels – which are fueling climate change with their heat-trapping pollution – to be in the energy mix for years to come. Democrats, meanwhile, have passed legislation to dramatically speed up the clean energy transition and prioritize the development of wind, solar and electrical transmission to get renewables sending electricity into homes faster. On Wednesday, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York said Democrats want to pass more climate legislation if they take back a full majority in Congress. He later told CNN the GOP is “way behind” on climate and there’s been “too little” progress on the party’s stances. “I think we’d get a lot more done with a Democratic House, a Democratic president and continuing to have a Democratic Senate,” Schumer told CNN. “Unfortunately, if you look at some of the Republican House and Senate Super PACs, huge amounts of money come from gas, oil and coal.” Even though Curtis and Romney are aligned on the party needing to talk about climate change, they differ on how to fix it. While Curtis primarily supports carbon capture and increased research and development into new technologies, Romney is one of the few Republicans speaking in favor of a carbon tax – taxing companies for their pollution. “It’s very unlikely that a price on carbon would be acceptable in the House of Representatives,” Romney said. “I think you might find a few Republican senators that would be supportive, but that’s not enough.” The idea certainly doesn’t have the support of Trump, or other 2024 candidates for president, and experts predict climate policy will get little to no airtime during the upcoming presidential race. “Regrettably, the issue of climate change is currently being held hostage to the culture wars in America,” Edward Maibach, a professor of climate communication at George Mason University and a co-founder of a nationwide climate polling project conducted with Yale University, told CNN in an email. “Donald Trump’s climate denial stance will have a chilling effect on the climate positions of his rivals on the right — even those who know better.” Even if climate-conscious Republicans say Trump won’t be in the party forever, Inglis said even a few more years may not be enough time to counteract the rapid changes already happening. “That’s still a long way away,” Inglis said. “The scientists are saying we can’t wait, get moving, get moving.”",Liberal
CNN,"It’s the summer of changed climate. Get used to it Here’s a hot take on the summer of 2023: The climate you grew up in is gone, replaced by something new and changing, but also inalterably different – where the Atlantic Ocean can reach hot-tub temperature, heat is a recurring public health concern and people will have to adapt their way of living. In this year of epic heat, it’s time to start thinking about how the climate changed rather than the fact of its changing. From a historical standpoint, we are in uncharted territory. This is not just the hottest month in human history. It may be the hottest month in 120,000 years, according to scientists in Europe. From a daily life standpoint, things are different Nearly half the US is under a heat advisory this week, and the country’s largest power grid was on alert. The warnings that more fires, floods and storms would occur as the atmosphere heated up are here. A large portion of the country has seen smoke come and go from those Canadian wildfires. Tourists in Greece were forced to flee in the country’s largest-ever evacuation. Towns unused to flooding were under water this year in Vermont. Torrential rain flooded Boston’s Fenway park. The same weather won’t occur every year The West Coast of the US, for instance, has gotten a respite so far from wildfires thanks to epic rainfall earlier in the year. But we can expect more heat more often. Asked by CNN’s Zain Asher about a heat index in Iran that approached 150 degrees Fahrenheit, Marina Romanello, executive director of the Lancet Countdown on Health and Climate Change, said to prepare for more. “What we know is the heat will become much more intense, much more frequent, and that if we don’t act urgently to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, then the outlook will be very serious with, as you said, temperatures that are beyond the limits of physiological survival.” Are we acting urgently? Asher pointed out California is phasing out gas-powered car sales. Romanello said the basic move would be to commit to phase out fossil fuels. But countries are not yet on that path or anywhere close to it. When the new extremes come, they feel remarkable Take a look at Arizona, where Phoenix has endured nearly a full straight month of 110-plus-degree days. Cacti can’t stand the heat and are dying. Hospitals have been taxed. Doctors are treating people burned just by falling on the ground, according to one CNN report. The Phoenix area medical examiner has brought in extra refrigerated containers for bodies, like it did during spikes of Covid-19, to deal with potential overflow. Maricopa County has 25 heat-related deaths so far, but another 249 are under investigation. Cities like Phoenix are urban hot boxes The urban density that creates economic opportunity also makes cities hotter than their surrounding areas. There can be variation up to 8 degrees between portions of a city with trees and green space and those that are mostly pavement. “These giant swings in temperature over short distances in cities, known as the urban heat island effect, make heat waves even worse,” writes CNN’s Rachel Ramirez of a new report by the nonprofit research group Climate Central. “Areas blanketed with asphalt, buildings, industry and freeways tend to absorb the sun’s energy then radiate more heat, while areas with abundant green space – parks, rivers, and tree-lined streets – radiate less heat and provide shade.” Ramirez notes that cities are looking for new ways to adapt, like painting roads white in Los Angeles, painting roofs in New York and more. In hot water Coral reefs off the Florida Keys, unable to stand the 100-plus-degree temperatures charted in some areas, are suffering a mass bleaching event, according to CNN’s Eric Zerkel, who writes experts were stunned at the two-week escalation that could kill some reefs off. That’s a very real and grim consequence. More theoretical is the possibility that the series of currents that circulates water around the oceans simply collapses. A study published in the journal Nature this week suggested the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Current, which includes the Gulf Stream, could collapse as early as 2025. Melting ice could dilute ocean water and alter the currents, which would affect everyone on the planet. There’s a climate change angle for everywhere and everything The reason gas prices have spiked in recent days? On top of OPEC holding back supply, excessive heat is affecting productivity at oil refineries. In the US, while President Joe Biden has made pledges to make the US carbon neutral in the coming decades, he is not completely opposed to new oil projects. It was seen as a political win for him and West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin, a Democrat, that the Supreme Court cleared the way Thursday for a new pipeline running through West Virginia. That news came the same day the White House announced new relief measures for people suffering from the record heat, including the creation of a new “heat hazard alert” system to clarify precautions for workers. “I don’t think anybody can deny the impact of climate change anymore,” Biden said, announcing the measures. What’s the priority here? A majority of Americans – 52% – said in Gallup survey in March, before this heat wave, that protecting the environment should be prioritized even if it hurts the economy. That’s compared with 43% who said the government should prioritize economic growth even if it hurts the environment. However. The numbers may fluctuate depending on how people feel about the health of the economy. But the share who prioritize economic growth over the environment has on the whole risen in Gallup’s polling over the long term. Between 1985 and 2002, that number never topped 40%. The partisan divide over climate change is also the largest it has ever been. Enjoy your vacation The geophysicist Bill McGuire, a professor at University College London and author of “Hothouse Earth: An Inhabitant’s Guide,” writes for CNN Opinion this week that people’s vacations as we know them are over. He points to tourists who had to flee the island of Rhodes in Greece to get away from wildfires. “It would be a big mistake to regard these as freak events and to continue holidaying as usual in the years ahead,” McGuire writes. “On the contrary, the extreme weather conditions across southern Europe this summer are a wake-up call – a reminder that not even our vacations are insulated from the growing consequences of global heating.”",Liberal
CNN,"Biden unveils new measures aimed at addressing extreme heat as US swelters President Joe Biden on Thursday unveiled a whole-of-government approach to protecting communities and workers from what he called the “real crisis” of extreme heat amid a recent spate of high temperatures and 150 million Americans are under heat alerts. “Part of the reason we’re here today is to get the word out so state and local governments know these resources are available and use them. I want the American people to know: Help is here and we’re going to make it available to anyone who needs it,” Biden said Thursday, calling on Americans to listen to public officials, stay indoors if vulnerable, know the signs of heat stroke, be careful on hot pavement, “always have a bottle of water” and take advantage of cooling centers. Around 150 million people from coast to coast are under heat alerts Thursday after extreme heat expanded into the highly populated I-95 corridor, bringing the highest temperatures of the year there. The heat also won’t let up in the South and Southwest, where heat-related deaths are climbing, emergency rooms are filling with heat-related burn victims and even animals are falling victim to heat illness. Heat indexes – a measure of what the temperature feels like when accounting for relative humidity – are expected to top 100 degrees Fahrenheit across many areas in the Midwest, mid-Atlantic and Northeast through Friday. Biden announced that he’s asked acting Labor Secretary Julie Su to issue a “heat hazard alert” clarifying protections for workers. “We should be protecting workers from hazardous conditions, and we will. And those states where they do not, I’m going to be calling them out,” he warned. Su, he said, will also work with her team, to “intensify enforcement, increasing inspection in high-risk industries like construction and agriculture.” The US Forest Service is awarding more than $1 billion in grants for the planting of trees that is aimed at helping to bring down temperatures in the long term. The Department of Housing and Urban Development, he added, is providing “billions” to make buildings more efficient and more heat-resistant, as well as for the opening of cooling centers. The Department of Interior, he said, is using infrastructure funding to expand water storage capacity to deal with future droughts. And NOAA, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, is partnering with universities and impacted communities “to improve the nation’s weather forecasts and its accuracy.” Biden pressed the importance of the local officials on the “front lines.” Phoenix Mayor Kate Gallego and San Antonio Mayor Ron Nirenberg both participated in the conversation virtually, sharing their perspectives in dealing the extreme heat challenges. The president also spoke more broadly about the impact of heat and climate change. “I don’t think anybody can deny the impact of climate change anymore… I don’t know anybody who honestly believes climate change is not a serious problem,” he said, pointing to droughts, hurricanes, wildfires and record temperatures. Phoenix, he noted, has had temperatures over 110 degrees for 27 straight days, and he referenced ocean temperatures near Miami “like a hot tub” topping 100 degrees. Heat, Biden said, has been “the number one weather-related killer,” with 600 people dying annually from its effects, “more than from floods, hurricanes, and tornadoes in America combined.” He told the story of an elderly woman in Phoenix who fell out of her wheelchair and had third-degree burns after five minutes on the hot ground, and noted farm workers and firefighters and construction workers who “risk their lives” working in extreme heat. “Folks, we really want to pretend these things are normal? Experts say extreme heat is already costing America $100 billion a year and hits our most vulnerable the hardest: seniors, people experiencing homelessness who have nowhere to turn, disadvantaged communities. … And it’s threatening farms, fisheries, forests that so many families depend on to make a living.” He also went after “MAGA extremists” in Congress, who, he said, are trying to repeal legislative progress. And he called on Americans to visit heat.gov, a national integrated heat health information system.",Liberal
BBC,"Climate change: UN calls for radical changes to stem warming Tackling climate change needs a rapid transformation of the way our world works, travels, eats and uses energy, according to an important UN review. This is the first ""global stocktake"" to examine the efforts of countries to reduce planet-warming emissions since the Paris agreement was signed in 2015. While progress has been made, efforts now need to be massively scaled up. The report calls for ""radical decarbonisation"" with a fast phase out of fossil fuels without carbon capture. Burning fossil fuels like oil, gas and coal to generate electricity emits carbon dioxide, which is the main driver of climate change. Carbon capture in industrial processes and power stations stops most of the CO2 produced from being released, and either reuses it or stores it underground. Renewable energy also needs significant expansion while deforestation needs to be halted and reversed by 2030. The stocktake report will be considered by political leaders and will be central to global climate talks in Dubai later this year. Over the course of the past two years, the UN has set out to review the promises made by countries who signed the Paris agreement in 2015. At the meeting eight years ago, countries agreed to keep the amount of warming since the industrial revolution well below 2C and make efforts to keep it under 1.5C. The report examines their efforts to cut carbon, to adapt to climate change and how they have mobilised finance and technology to help poorer nations deal with the problem. No country is named and shamed in this report, which considers the collective approach to tackling the problem. Much progress has been made, the document acknowledges, but the global rise in temperatures predicted for this century is still well above what was promised in Paris. Keeping to those goals will now require a significant uptick in ambition according to the stocktake, which calls for widespread ""system transformation"". This means that every aspect of our societies needs to change to rein in rising temperatures. This includes the way we make energy, the way we travel, work and produce food. Experts say this type of change needs governments to take the initiative and make sure that their climate actions aren't immediately nullified by other policies and investments. ""One could also see the call for system transformations as a recognition that, while we still can, we should take our destiny in our own hands,"" said Dr Richard Klein from the Stockholm Environment Institute, who was involved in the initial stages of the stocktake. ""Either we transform society in a way that avoids the worst of climate change, or climate change will transform society for us, in ways that are difficult to foresee but likely not to be very pleasant."" The report makes a clear call for the rapid scaling up of renewable energy sources including wind and solar but also says that fossil fuels that don't capture the carbon they produce have no future. The stocktake says that these are ""indispensable elements"" of a just transition to net zero by the middle of this century. Electric vehicles ""offer the greatest mitigation potential"" in the transport sector, according to the report which also underlines the fact that shifting to climate friendly, healthy diets, reducing food waste and fostering sustainable agriculture can make a significant difference to limiting emissions. The stocktake also examines efforts on climate adaptation and finance, something that has been a constant source of anger for developing countries. It calls for a rapid scaling up of finance from an expanded range of sources. The idea of a stocktake is to ensure that the next set of plans to cut carbon that governments register with the UN in 2025 will be more ambitious than the current ones. However the report will also form the basis of discussions at the COP28 global climate talks to be held in Dubai later this year. Efforts at COP27 to agree a phase out of all unabated fossil fuels failed due to resistance from several major oil producing nations. UN officials believe the stocktake report will increase the pressure for a major statement at COP28. ""I urge governments to carefully study the findings of the report and ultimately understand what it means for them and the ambitious action they must take next,"" said Simon Stiell, executive secretary of UN Climate Change. Observers agree that the document is a wake-up call. ""We already know the world is failing to meet its climate goals, but leaders now have a concrete blueprint underpinned by a mountain of evidence for how to get the job done,"" said Ani Dasgupta from the World Resources Institute.",Liberal
BBC,"How climate change worsens heatwaves, droughts, wildfires and floods Extreme weather is becoming more frequent and more intense in many places because of climate change. Scientists say this will continue whilst humans keep releasing planet-warming greenhouse gases. Here are four ways climate change is linked to extreme weather. 1. Hotter, longer heatwaves Even a small increase to average temperatures makes a big difference. This is because the whole distribution of daily temperatures shifts to warmer levels, making hotter days more likely and more extreme. Scientists use computer simulations to assess whether extreme weather events have been made more likely by warming caused by humans. For example, the intense heatwaves that hit southern Europe and the southern US and Mexico in July 2023 would have been ""virtually impossible"" without human-caused climate change, according to the World Weather Attribution network (WWA). But these events are no longer rare. If global warming reaches 2C above the pre-industrial period - before humans started burning fossil fuels at scale - these events are expected to happen every 2-5 years, the WWA warns. In the UK, temperatures topped 40C for the first time on record in July 2022. This would have been ""extremely unlikely"" without climate change, the WWA says. As well as happening more frequently, heatwaves are becoming longer and more intense in many places, including the UK, where 2022 was the warmest year on record. This can happen as a result of ""heat domes"" - an area of high pressure where hot air is pushed down and trapped in place, causing temperatures to soar over large areas. One theory suggests higher temperatures in the Arctic - which has warmed more than four times faster than the global average - are causing strong winds called the jet stream to slow, increasing the likelihood of heat domes. 2. Longer droughts Linking climate change with specific individual droughts can be difficult. The availability of water depends on more than just temperature and rainfall. But longer and more intense heatwaves can worsen droughts by drying out soils. This means the air above warms up more quickly, leading to more intense heat. Increased demand for water from humans and farmers in hot weather puts even more stress on the water supply. In parts of East Africa, there were five failed rainy seasons in a row between 2020 and 2022, as the region suffered its worst drought for 40 years. Climate change has made droughts like this at least 100 times more likely, according to the WWA. 3. More fuel for wildfires Fires happen naturally in many parts of the world. It's difficult to know if climate change has caused a specific wildfire to spread because other factors are also relevant, like changes to the way land is used. But climate change is making the ""fire weather"" conditions needed for their spread more likely, according to the UN's climate body, the IPCC. Extreme and long-lasting heat draws more and more moisture out of the ground and vegetation. These tinder-dry conditions provide fuel for fires, which can spread at an incredible speed, particularly if winds are strong. Canada is experiencing its worst wildfire season on record, with over 160,000 sq km (40 million acres) already burnt. Climate change more than doubled the likelihood of the extreme ""fire weather"" conditions in eastern Canada that allowed the fires to spread, according to the WWA. There have also been severe wildfires in Greece, Chile and Australia in 2023. Global fire trends are complicated because of changing land use, but many regions have seen increases in the area burnt by extreme wildfires in recent decades, including the western US and Canada. Wildfires are projected to become more frequent and intense in future globally due to the the combined effects of land use and climate change, according to a recent report by the UN Environment Programme. It suggested that the number of the most extreme fires may increase by up to 50% by 2100. 4. More extreme rain For every 1C rise in average temperature, the atmosphere can hold about 7% more moisture. This can result in more droplets and heavier rainfall, sometimes in a shorter space of time and over a smaller area. In 2022, Pakistan experienced its wettest July and August on record, triggering devastating floods affecting more than 33 million people. It is ""likely"" that climate change played a role, according to the WWA, but natural weather patterns like the monsoon may have been involved too. Not all extreme rainfall events can be attributed to climate change, as other factors like natural variability or changes to land use can play a role. For example, climate change had a ""limited"" role in the heavy rainfall that hit the Emilia-Romagna region in northern Italy in May 2023, the WWA says. But globally, the frequency and intensity of heavy rainfall events has increased over most land regions due to human activity, according to the IPCC. And heavy precipitation will generally become more frequent and intense with further warming, the IPCC says.",Liberal
BBC,"Africa proposes global carbon taxes to fight climate change African leaders have proposed a global carbon tax regime in a joint declaration. The Nairobi Declaration capped the three-day Africa Climate Summit in Kenya's capital. The document, released on Wednesday, demanded that major polluters commit more resources to help poorer nations. African heads of state said they will use it as the basis of their negotiating position at November's COP28 summit. The African Climate Summit was dominated by discussions on how to mobilise financing to adapt to increasingly extreme weather, conserve natural resources and develop renewable energy. Africa is among the most vulnerable continents to the impact of climate change, but according to researchers, it only receives about 12% of the nearly $300bn (£240bn) in annual financing it needs to cope. The Nairobi Declaration urged world leaders ""to rally behind the proposal for a global carbon taxation regime including a carbon tax on fossil fuel trade, maritime transport and aviation, that may also be augmented by a global financial transaction tax"". Human rights activist Graça Machel told the BBC the declaration was ""a huge step forward"". ""Africa is a player, the world cannot go without having Africa at the centre,"" she said. ""Africa is not here to be helped. Africa is here to offer opportunities to offer investment, to offer solutions."" The Nairobi Declaration said such measures would ensure large-scale financing for climate-related investments and insulate the issue of tax rises from geopolitical and domestic political pressures. Around two dozen countries currently impose taxes on carbon, according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), but the idea of a global carbon tax regime has failed to gain much traction. On Tuesday, Kenya's President William Ruto referred to past proposals in the European Union for a financial transaction tax. Conservation groups in 2011 said money raised from the tax should finance environmental priorities, but the European Commission's proposal never won the unanimous approval required from the European Council to become law. Joab Bwire Okanda, a senior advisor at the Christian Aid charity, said the call for a global carbon tax was welcome but that ""to make polluters really pay, false solutions like carbon credits that allow polluters a free ride without taking meaningful action need to be consigned to the dustbin"". Some activists say the credits, which allow polluters to offset emissions by funding green activities, are a pretext for big polluters to keep emitting carbon dioxide. Mr Ruto said international governments, development banks, private investors and philanthropists committed a combined $23bn (£18bn) to green projects over the three days, including hundreds of millions to a major carbon markets initiative. But African leaders acknowledged that those kinds of investments only scratch the surface of the continent's financial needs and said more systemic changes were needed. Some analysts said the summit had not focused enough on how to help Africans adapt to extreme weather. Protesters also criticised the conference, demonstrating outside the event against Africa's plan to sell carbon credits to foreign countries. Several foreign companies and countries have committed hundreds of millions in carbon credit purchases from the Africa Carbon Markets Initiative (ACMI), including the United Arab Emirates, which pledged to buy $450m (£358m).",Liberal
BBC,"Climate change Global climate change refers to weather changes across the entire Earth. These include warming temperatures and changes in rainfall. Climate change has many significant impacts. Plants and animals Climate change is affecting plants and animals. For instance, the increase in temperature is causing some animals to change their behaviour, such as birds migrating earlier in the spring. Additionally, climate change is causing many plants to flower earlier in the year or change the timing of their growth cycle, which can impact the availability of food for animals. Another example is the melting of Arctic Sea ice, causing polar bears to lose their habitat and struggle to find enough food to survive. These are just a few examples: climate change is affecting plants and animals in many ways. Rising sea level Sea levels are rising due to global warming. Firstly, glaciers and ice sheets worldwide are melting and adding water to the ocean. Secondly, the volume of the ocean is increasing as the water warms. When the sea levels rise, flooding happens more frequently. Seawater flooding can ruin crops with salt water in farming areas beside the coast. The seawater may also get into underground stores of fresh water and spoil the supplies. A rising sea level in towns beside the sea will cause more flooding and damage to houses, gardens, shops and other buildings and businesses. Change in weather Climate change happens when the Earth's temperature gets hotter because of pollution caused by people. This makes the weather change too. Sometimes it gets too hot, sometimes it rains too much, and sometimes it's too cold. Food Climate change can affect food supplies in many ways. When the weather gets too hot or too dry, crops such as fruits and vegetables can't grow well. This means there won't be as much food to eat, and buying food might become more expensive. Sometimes, there can be too much rain or flooding, which can also damage crops and make it harder for farmers to grow food. Animals that people eat can also be affected by climate change because they need certain temperatures and environments to survive. If the Earth keeps getting hotter because of climate change, growing enough food for everyone could become even harder. Water supply Climate change affects water supply in a few ways. When it gets hotter, there can be more evaporation, which means that water in lakes, rivers, and oceans can disappear. This can lead to droughts, which means there won't be enough water for people to use for drinking, washing, and farming. On the other hand, if there is too much rain, there can be floods and too much water, which can also affect water supplies. Climate change can also affect water quality, making it harder to clean and use.",Liberal
BBC,"Climate change: Rathlin Island gets £4.6m for Green Transition project A Rathlin Island project has been granted £4.625 million over the next two years to innovate on waste management and other environmental challenges. The funding comes from the Arts and Humanities Research Council. The project, called Future Island-Island, will be one of the UK's four new Green Transition Ecosystems (GTEs). It will look at sustainable resource management and protecting the island from any negative impacts of tourism. The project aims to bolster awareness and improve public engagement around waste management. It will be led by Ulster University in partnership with Queen's University Belfast. It will use Rathlin Island as an innovation test centre. Its six pillars include plastic pollution, protecting natural habitats and waste management. The work might include repurposing waste plastics into materials for 3D printing. Rathlin Island has a net zero target of 2030, two decades ahead of the Northern Ireland-wide target of 2050. GTEs aim to translate design-led research into real-world benefits, concentrating on the challenges posed by climate change. They are part of the £25m Future Observatory: Design the Green Transition programme, funded by the Arts and Humanities Research Council with support from the UK Government, and delivered in partnership with the Design Museum. The Glasgow School of Art and University of the Arts London will provide expertise to the locally-led consortium. David Quinney Mee of the Rathlin Development Community Association said the partnership with the project was ""of value beyond current measure"". He added that the island could become a ""best practice model"" for other places across the UK and internationally. As well as looking at waste management and sustainable tourism on the island, the Future Island-Island project will work with the RSPB to ""significantly"" expand the LIFE Raft scheme. The project will work with two Belfast Regional City Deals, the Ulster University-led Studio Ulster, and Queen's University Belfast-led Advanced Manufacturing Innovation Centre (AMIC). 'Significant opportunity' The funding announcement was welcomed by Professor Justin Magee, Principal Investigator and Research Director for Art and Design at Ulster University. ""This is a significant opportunity for the design community to demonstrate inventive propositions to stimulate change around key global challenges."" And he said building the project around a small island off the coast of another small island would ""exemplify how these small rural islands, under the correct conditions, can deliver high level innovation to drive prosperity and enable change."" Co-investigator Professor Greg Keefe from Queen's School of Natural and Built Environment said the ""exciting and innovative"" project has the potential to improve how people live, both in Northern Ireland and further afield.",Liberal
BBC,"Climate change: Call to power council vehicles with vegetable oil Council vehicles should be run on vegetable oil to cut carbon emissions, a fuel supplier has said. Oil4Wales founder Colin Owens claimed hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO) could be used instead of diesel fuel. He said it could be used as a ""stepping stone"" towards cleaner solutions, delaying the need to buy replacement electric vehicles. But an energy expert has warned doing so would only act as a stopgap. The fuel, which is made from vegetable and animal oils or used cooking oil, currently costs around £1.94 a litre for road users - compared to around £1.51 for standard white diesel. The Welsh Local Government Association (WLGA) said there could be ""limitations in attempting to switch to electric in the case of heavy goods vehicles"", and that emissions needed to be reduced in a ""cost-effective way"". Council mulls diesel bin lorries amid grid concern Diesel and petrol cars widespread in public sector Climate change: Wales falling behind on targets - report But energy expert Carol Bell said renewable diesel was no more than a ""short term tactical solution to eke out more life from existing vehicles and systems"". ""I think it does have a place, but whether it has a major place is a big question,"" she said. ""Ultimately to invest in this kind of production, now, we would have to recognise that it has a finite life, because we have to wean ourselves off any kind of hydrocarbon fuel in reasonably quick order."" Ms Bell said the public sector in particular needed to take a long-term view, and ""ways of financing the transition for individuals and councils should be found"". Cut emissions by 90% Mr Owens argued that if more public authorities were to use HVO or renewable diesel, the overall price for the consumer would come down. He also said it would delay the costly replacement of vehicles. ""It reduces emissions by 90%,"" Mr Owens said. ""They've been using it in California for two to three years, and their carbon emissions have dramatically reduced."" How does it compare on price? Standard white diesel : 124.83 pence per litre (ppl) (+VAT 20%) Renewable diesel/HVO : 151.23ppl (+VAT 20% Kerosene : 69.49ppl (+VAT 5% under 2,300 litres) Renewable heating diesel : 118.96ppl + (VAT 20%) (Source: OIL4WALES, prices correct on 29/8/23) Both Cambridge and South Cambridgeshire councils found using HVO instead of diesel in their bin lorries cut carbon emissions by 90%. Mr Owens' call has been backed by Plaid Cymru Ceredigion MP Ben Lake, who said the UK government needed to reconsider how much VAT is paid on the oil. ""I certainly think it has potential, not least because it is a drop-in fuel and many local authorities will have fleets of vehicles that could easily transition over to this fuel,"" Mr Lake said. Heating rural homes Mr Owens also argued that rural homeowners who currently use standard heating oil or kerosene can use HVO with some modifications to existing boilers. Around 10% of Welsh households use heating oil, according to Welsh government figures, which equates to around 130,000 homes, mainly in rural areas. The sale of replacement oil boilers will be banned from 2026. The ban has been described as a ""rural ULEZ"" by Conservative MP George Eustice. Rural homes will face having to replace their ageing oil boilers with either air source or ground source heating, with costs ranging anywhere between £10,000 to £20,000 to retrofit a home. HVO is being trialled in the Cornish village of Kehelland, with 20 households using the renewable fuel instead of standard heating oil. Fuel distributors claim it leads to a 90% reduction in carbon emissions over kerosene. Mr Owens has also called for fuel duty on HVO for heating to be cut to make it more competitive on price. The UK government said it was keeping the taxation of HVO ""under review"". The Welsh government said it would ""continue to assess the evidence on potential market developments, the sustainability, costs and consumer impacts of biofuels"". Ministers in Wales aim to make Wales net-zero by 2050, meaning the amount of greenhouse gas emissions produced by Welsh homes and businesses would be equal to or less than the emissions removed from the environment.",Liberal
BBC,"Climate change: Lough Neagh temperature rises 'alarmingly' The water temperature in Lough Neagh is rising ""alarmingly fast"" researchers have said. The temperature in the largest freshwater body of water in the UK and Ireland is 1C higher than in 1995. A report also said more than twice as much carbon was stored in ground around the lough as previously thought. The Lough Neagh Partnership (LNP) commissioned the study as it took up a lease on land on the south-west shoreline, with a view to restoring it. Many peatlands around the lough have been milled over the years for compost and fuel. The Climate Change Impact and Carbon Storage Study took core samples round the entire shoreline of the lough to assess the carbon stored there. In some cases, those samples went 9m down below grass fields. The report revealed a total of more than 14 million tonnes of carbon stored in the catchment area. ""Previously our best estimate of carbon stored in the Lough Neagh catchment area was about 6.6 million tonnes,"" said report author Jim McAdam. ""We got that from the surface soil maps that were done in the 1990s. In this study, we looked at the actual depth of the carbon itself, and we've come out with our calculation of carbon."" ""It's more than 14 million tonnes of carbon, over twice what our original estimate was. ""That's really important, because nowadays the whole talk is how do we keep that carbon in the ground? That carbon and that habitat has the potential to sequester more carbon. ""So the more we have the better and, therefore, the more we know about it, the more we've measured, the better we can manage the whole site."" That whole site includes lands at Derrytresk and Derryloughan, which were gifted to the Royal School Dungannon in 1608, at about the time of the Plantation of Ulster. It covers 320 acres. The Education Authority granted a lease on the land to the LNP in December 2022. The site has been affected by unregulated peat extraction. The partnership will now manage the site with a focus on conservation, restoring the peatlands and enhancing the natural habitat. The partnership's manager Gerry Darby said: ""There has to be a balance between legal - and I emphasise legal - peat extraction, between that and protecting important species [like the curlew] as well. ""We're just trying to find that balance and the community, I think, are very supportive in trying to find that balance as well."" Mid Ulster Council said it was investigating seven potential breaches of planning in peat extraction. It is also considering a planning application for extraction. In the Republic of Ireland, a ban on extraction in Special Areas of Conservation was introduced in 2011. A ban on the use of turf as fuel was also brought in by the Irish government in October 2022. In Northern Ireland, a peatlands strategy has been consulted on but cannot proceed without sign-off from a Stormont minister. It is expected to include a ban on peat sales from 2025. That, farmer Michael Meharg said, will need incentives. He said: ""There are government policies on peatland, there are government policies on farming with nature and being environmentally conscious and friendly. ""So passing bills when there's some sort of economic gain to be with it, it's very difficult to ask people to do something just for the sake of it."" The partnership's shoreline environment officer, Peter Harper, is aware of the tradition of peat in the area. However, he is also aware of what healthy peatlands mean for the environment. ""These are very important carbon stores. Now, traditionally, they have been extracted for compost and there's a commercial industry around that and that's fine,"" he said. ""But I don't think that can continue indefinitely because collectively, all these actions do have an impact on climate change.""",Liberal
BBC,"Climate change: Thousands of penguins die in Antarctic ice breakup A catastrophic die-off of emperor penguin chicks has been observed in the Antarctic, with up to 10,000 young birds estimated to have been killed. The sea-ice underneath the chicks melted and broke apart before they could develop the waterproof feathers needed to swim in the ocean. The birds most likely drowned or froze to death. The event, in late 2022, occurred in the west of the continent in an area fronting on to the Bellingshausen Sea. It was recorded by satellites. Dr Peter Fretwell, from the British Antarctic Survey (BAS), said the wipeout was a harbinger of things to come. More than 90% of emperor penguin colonies are predicted to be all but extinct by the end of the century, as the continent's seasonal sea-ice withers in an ever-warming world. ""Emperors depend on sea-ice for their breeding cycle; it's the stable platform they use to bring up their young. But if that ice is not as extensive as it should be or breaks up faster, these birds are in trouble,"" he told BBC News. ""There is hope: we can cut our carbon emissions that are causing the warming. But if we don't we will drive these iconic, beautiful birds to the verge of extinction."" The scientists tracked five colonies in the Bellingshausen Sea sector - at Rothschild Island, Verdi Inlet, Smyley Island, Bryan Peninsula and Pfrogner Point. Using the EU's Sentinel-2 satellites, they were able to observe the penguins' activity from the excrement, or guano, they left on the white sea-ice. This brown staining is visible even from space. Adult birds jump out on to the sea-ice around March as the Southern Hemisphere winter approaches. They court, copulate, lay eggs, brood those eggs, and then feed their nestlings through the following months until it's time for the young to make their own way in the world. This normally occurs around December/January time, when the new birds head out into the ocean. But the research team watched as sea-ice under emperor rookeries fragmented in November, before thousands of chicks had had time to fledge the slick feathers needed for swimming. Four of the colonies suffered total breeding failure as a result. Only the most northerly site, at Rothschild Island, had some success. Antarctic summer sea-ice has been on a sharp downturn since 2016, with the total area of frozen water around the continent diminishing to new record lows. The two absolute lowest years have occurred in the past two summer seasons, in 2021/22 and in 2022/23, when the Bellingshausen was almost completely devoid of ice cover. What is more, the slowness of floes to form in recent months means the colonies will probably not be producing chicks for at least another year. Winter maximum sea-ice extent, normally reached in September, will track far below where it would normally be. Dr Fretwell and colleagues said the emperors were feeling the impacts of this shift in conditions. Between 2018 and 2022, roughly a third of the more than 60 known emperor penguin colonies were affected in some way by diminished sea-ice extent - whether that's ice forming later in the season or breaking up earlier. At the other end of the planet, in the Arctic, the sea-ice has been in a decades-long, steady decline. The Antarctic in contrast seemed more robust. Up until 2016, it was becoming slightly more extensive year on year. BAS colleague Dr Caroline Holmes is an expert on Antarctic sea-ice. She links the causes for the current decline to anomalously warm ocean water around the continent and a particular pattern of winds, which in the case of the Bellingshausen, has pushed ice back towards the coast, making it difficult to spread. These were remarkable times, she said. ""What we're seeing right now is so far outside what we've observed previously. We expected change but I don't think we expected so much change so rapidly,"" she told BBC News. ""Studies in the Arctic have suggested that if we could reverse climate warming somehow, the sea-ice in the polar north would recover. Whether that might also apply in the Antarctic, we don't know. But there's every reason to think that if it got cold enough, the sea-ice would reform."" Currently, emperors are classified as ""Near Threatened"" by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), the organisation that keeps the lists of Earth's most endangered animals. A proposal has been made to lift emperors into the more urgent ""Vulnerable"" category because of the danger posed by climate warming to their way of life.",Liberal

Watch this TikTok from the BBC Verify team, who explain why climate change is real and define what global warming is. As the presenter says, the science couldn’t be clearer – climate change is a fact and it can’t be denied. More extreme weather events are now more common due to the planet getting hotter. There are occasions where there can be some debate about what we do to try and prevent more warming, for example discussions about how quickly to act and what actions might be best. But if something has been proven to be a fact, why is there so much misleading information about it? What are the different types of fake news about climate change? Climate change misinformation There are two big types of fake news – misinformation and disinformation. Misinformation is fake news that is created and spread by a MIStake – by someone who doesn’t realise that it’s false. Some aspects of climate change can seem complex, and because of this, people might make mistakes when trying to understand the science. For example, calling climate change “natural” is misinformation that someone might spread. A common myth is that there’s always been temperature increases and so climate change is perfectly natural and nothing to worry about. Whilst there’s some truth in this, as we have had temperature increases throughout time, it can be misleading, because the changes we’re seeing at the moment are predominantly down to human behaviour and non-natural causes. Get the facts on global warming here with The Regenerators from BBC Bitesize. Climate change disinformation As well as people making genuine mistakes, there are some people who benefit from spreading fake news about the planet. They may do this to make money, make a political point or just cause trouble. This would be classed as disinformation – fake news that’s created or spread deliberately, by someone who knows full well that it’s false. For example, the widespread online conspiracy that the arrest of climate activist Greta Thunberg had been staged for publicity purposes. Many social media posts and videos suggested that the police waited around deliberately to pose and smile for the cameras with Greta. However, the facts were that it was a real protest (activists were demonstrating against the expansion of a coal mine) and that Greta was detained, rather than arrested. Local police told the BBC that they were waiting for transport rather than holding a photo opportunity. Yet despite these facts being out in the open, people still chose to spread the conspiracy that it was a fake arrest which had been staged. This could be seen as an example of climate change disinformation, and result in people questioning whether they should trust Greta. In turn, this may lead people to doubt the science behind climate change and the impact it could have. There are many reasons why people spread or create fake news, whether by accident or on purpose.

BBC,"Climate change: Flintshire cement work's carbon capture plan A cement works has plans to pipe 800,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide a year out to sea to fight climate change. Cement giant Hanson claims capturing carbon could play a vital role in the UK reaching its net-zero targets. The company is planning a £400m facility at its Padeswood plant in Flintshire, making it the first carbon capture-enabled cement works in the UK. While Greenpeace objects to some uses of carbon capture, it accepted it may be necessary for cement production. Hanson is one of several companies chosen by the UK government to progress plans for carbon-reducing solutions as part of the HyNet project. It would see CO2 pumped from companies in the north-west of England and north Wales and locked into depleted gas fields under the sea bed in Liverpool Bay using a huge network of pipes. A large proportion of Hanson's emissions come from the chemical processes involved in making cement. The company said the UK ""simply cannot achieve its net-zero goals without the building materials we use being carbon neutral"". Marian Garfield, Hanson's director of sustainability, said Padeswood would become the first cement works in the UK to become ""true net zero"". Last month, the UK government announced that the Acorn Project in Aberdeenshire was the latest of four carbon capture projects which will share up to £20bn of funding. Ms Garfield said: ""The announcement by the government is confidence that they're really behind the net zero and carbon capture technology, so for us it was a good, positive sign."" Hanson has said it wants the carbon capture facility to be operational by 2027, but it will need planning permission, environmental permits, and a public consultation before it can go ahead. If approved, it said the project would be equivalent to taking 320,000 cars off the road. Hanson said there was no viable alternative to cement, which is carbon intensive to produce. Currently, carbon from Padeswood is released through a 110m (360ft) stack which dominates the skyline around the site. Under the plans it would instead be captured in a new facility built on fields next to the plant, covering an area roughly the size of seven football pitches. From there, it would be pumped several kilometres before joining HyNet's pipe network out to sea. Hanson claims the project would protect 222 existing jobs and create 54 full-time jobs. Its parent company, Heidelberg Materials, would fund the £400m project and is negotiating with the UK government on how it would be paid for the carbon it captures. Doug Parr, policy director for Greenpeace UK, said: ""What we know about carbon capture and storage where it's been used globally is that it's expensive and it's difficult to make work. ""We really shouldn't be relying on it to make lots and lots of our reduction in emissions that we need to tackle climate change. ""Worse than that, the fossil fuel industry have used it as a cover to carry on with business as usual. ""However, it's also true that in certain instances, like cement, it's very difficult to deal with it in any other way. In those circumstances, it probably is going to be necessary."" How does carbon capture and storage work? Burning fossil fuels like oil, gas and coal to generate electricity emits CO2, which is the main driver of climate change. The carbon capture process stops most of the CO2 produced from being released, and either re-uses it or stores it underground. The British government says the North Sea is an ideal place to store CO2. It has plenty of old empty oil and gas reservoirs, and also permeable rocks known as saline aquifers.",Liberal
BBC,"Climate change: Claim wind and solar may industrialise rural Wales More wind and solar farms would industrialise the Welsh countryside and affect about 50,000 acres of land, according to a rural charity. Offshore wind and rooftop solar should be the preferred way to cut carbon emissions, says the Campaign for the Protection of Rural Wales (CPRW). But a company proposing five energy parks in Wales said a mix will be needed to reach net zero by 2050. The Welsh government said a range of technologies was required. Wales currently has 44 operational wind farms and 123 solar farms, according to research by the CPRW. It has published a map showing those existing renewable energy projects and the locations of a further 34 wind farms and 92 solar farms being proposed. ""The biggest concern is the lack of awareness of what's happening in Wales,"" said the CPRW's Ross Evans. More than 3m trees have been cut down for onshore wind projects, the group claimed. ""All we're trying to do is to mitigate some of what's happening to the countryside and ensure we sacrifice the minimum amount [of land],"" he said. ""We're not just talking about common ground or forestry here,"" Mr Evans said. ""Farmland, nature reserves, SSSIs (Sites of Special Scientific Interest), curlew breeding areas, peatlands, they're all being destroyed for onshore wind and solar."" What are Wales' carbon reduction goals? The Welsh government set out in January its plan for 100% of the nation's electricity demand to be met by renewable sources by 2035. That will mean improving the electricity grid, community projects, cutting consumption and streamlining planning to allow more renewable projects to go ahead. The framework for planning decisions over the next two decades - set out in the Future Wales 2040 plan - outlines ten pre-assessed areas where there ""is a presumption in favour of large‐scale wind energy development"". The Welsh government will make the decision on 26 of the proposed wind farms and 36 of the solar farms, with the remaining projects left to local planning authorities. But CPRW said the Welsh government's strategy is out of date because it does not include potential for offshore wind farms, which the group said would generate more electricity than the onshore projects. ""Two offshore projects in the Celtic Sea and the Irish Sea on their own will produce more than double what Wales needs by 2050,"" Mr Evans said. CPRW wants a pause on ""all onshore wind and ground-based solar developments over 10MW"" until the potential of other sources of renewable energy is considered. What do wind developers say? Bute Energy has plans for five wind farms in Wales. The largest would be about five miles from Llandrindod Wells, Powys, in the Radnor forest, connecting to the national grid in Carmarthenshire via a 60-mile pylon network. Nant Mithil would have 36 wind turbines, each 220m (722ft) tall, producing enough electricity according to Bute to power 200,000 homes, while saving about 350,000 tonnes of CO2 each year. ""We as a nation are going to be turning off fossil fuels,"" said Bute's Aled Rowlands. ""Our need for electricity is going to go up dramatically - the way we heat our homes, the way we use vehicles. ""We need to be generating more energy, and of course we want to generate clean, green energy from onshore wind, and there are other options as well such as offshore wind.” 'Rushing Wales into wind power' Nant Mithil has faced opposition from local campaign group ReThink, which said it would ""destroy"" Radnor forest, hurting tourism and wildlife. ""We're not against renewable energy,"" said group spokeswoman Jenny Chryss. ""But we say there are much better ways - offshore, hydrogen, the floating platforms in the Celtic Sea. ""They're just rushing into Wales to do this, and it's not the right way to do it."" The Climate Change Committee - the UK's independent advisory body - said in June Wales was falling behind on efforts to cut emissions, and ""action on decarbonisation in Wales must accelerate"". Mr Rowlands said onshore wind will be a key part of meeting climate change targets. Is offshore wind the most cost effective? ""We need a mix of energy sources in order to ensure that we get to net zero,"" he said. But CPRW pointed to another report, commissioned by the Welsh government, highlighting the benefits of sea-based energy projects. One recommendation in the Future energy grids for Wales report said ""offshore wind is projected to be the most cost-effective and prominent electricity source in a net zero Welsh energy system, providing up to 80% by 2050."" ""It supports our long-held view,"" Mr Evans said, ""that offshore wind is not only the most cost-effective but also the most environmentally acceptable option amongst a range of technologies."" A Welsh government spokesperson said: ""We need a range of technologies, at different scales, to meet our future electricity needs as we move towards a net zero energy system. ""Wind and solar are cost-effective options to generate electricity and have a clear role to play,"" they added. ""We want to ensure local communities and people in Wales directly benefit from energy generated in Wales. We are taking action to support local and shared ownership and developing strong, local supply chains.""",Liberal
BBC,"Climate change: Last year's UK heatwave 'a sign of things to come' The record-breaking UK heat experienced in 2022 will be regarded as a cool year by the end of this century, the Met Office says. Its report shows that last year was ""extraordinary"", with a heatwave pushing the UK record over 40C for the first time. Hot years like 2022 will be the average by 2060, if carbon emissions are as expected, the authors say. By 2100, it would be a cooler-than-average year across the UK. Climate change is having an increasing impact on all parts of the UK, playing a key role in pushing last year's temperatures to record highs. While rain might be the dominant factor in the current UK climate, just a year ago the UK was suffering from a powerful heatwave that helped make 2022 the warmest year in records dating back to 1884, and also broke the central England temperature series that goes back to 1659. The UK's highest daily temperature last year was 40.3C, recorded at Coningsby in Lincolnshire, which beat the previous high mark by a significant margin. This was not an isolated incident, according to the Met Office, with persistent warmth prevalent across the year. The Met Office's State of the UK Climate report for 2022 shows that apart from December, every month last year was warmer than the 1991-2020 average. As well as persistent warmth, one key aspect of the study shows that extreme temperatures in the UK are changing much faster than the average. ""The actual extremes that we're seeing, the highest, the hottest days, those are really increasing markedly too,"" said lead author Mike Kendon. ""We're going to see very, very many more days, exceeding 30, 32 or 35C. So warmer summers will become very much more frequent, and hot days will become very much more frequent.” One of the elements that might have led to a very hot year in 2022 and may help explain the current wetter summer are changes in the jet stream, the fast-moving winds that carry weather systems across the Atlantic to the UK. In recent years the jet stream has shown a tendency to get stuck, meaning that weather patterns can persist or become ""blocked"" in place for weeks. There is a school of thought that a warming climate is causing this change. ""I think the jury is out, but there is definitely some science showing that we are getting these much more persistent, static kind of weather patterns, similar to what we've got at the moment with the heatwaves,"" said Prof Liz Bentley, from the Royal Meteorological Society. ""It will be interesting to see if there's conclusive evidence that climate change has led to that. And that's going to be a pattern that we see going forward in future."" The authors of the Met Office study say that 2022's record year for the UK was made much more likely by climate change. ""The heatwave that is happening now across southern Europe, the heatwave that we saw last year, all of these things are fitting into a pattern,"" said Mr Kendon. ""These things emphasise that our climate is changing. And it's changing now, and it's changing fast."" Looking forward, under a medium emissions scenario, there's a 1-in-15 chance that the UK would hit 40C in any one year by the end of the century. ""That trend for [extreme temperatures] is going to increase as we go through this century,"" said Prof Liz Bentley. ""If you look at future climate projections, we are on a path for hotter, drier summers. So 2022, for me was very much a sign of things to come in future years with our changing climate."" Earlier this month, the government's independent climate advisers warned the UK still needed to make climate change preparations a more important priority. The extreme 40C heat in July last year caused extensive disruption across the country, including for transport, power supply and healthcare. But even though these temperatures will become increasingly likely with climate change, the UK still has much further to go to properly prepare for intense heat and other extreme events, such as flooding, according to its advisers. The report also underlines some other key impacts of climate across the UK last year. The ten-year period from 2013 to 2022 is the warmest ten-year period on record. Near coasts, surface temperatures were the highest for the UK in a series dating back to 1870. Last year was also one of least snowy years on record, compared to the last six decades.",Liberal
BBC,"Travel disruption set to worsen with climate change, warns government adviser Travel disruption will be worsened by climate change unless more money is spent on the UK's transport networks, a government advisor has warned. Intense rainfall and heatwaves have hit road and rail travel with flash floods, landslips and equipment failures. Sir John Armitt said the UK must either accept more travel disruption or spend more money on maintenance and upgrades. Network Rail's safety and engineering director Martin Frobisher said companies were ""racing to catch up"". He insisted more was being spent than ever and technology was improving, but ""every year we...break records on heat, on rain, on wind"". Sir John, chair of the National Infrastructure Commission, said leaders including himself may previously have ""underestimated the impact of climate change and the rate at which we're seeing those changes"". The former chief executive of Network Rail also believes there are societal and political choices ahead, when it comes to keeping our transport networks running as reliably. Climate change is already affecting how we get around. Transport bosses are trying to react, to keep things running smoothly. Last summer's heatwaves caused widespread train cancellations, caused by issues including buckled rails and fallen overhead power lines. Railway tracks are engineered to cope with a certain range of temperatures, but when it gets very hot they can bend. When overhead power lines sag in the heat, they can get snagged in train equipment and be pulled down. Hot, dry weather followed by heavy rain can trigger landslips, or flash flooding. Network Rail, which is responsible for maintaining thousands of miles of railway across Britain, is trying to adapt. Spending on drainage has increased, and technology is being deployed to remotely monitor rail temperature. Simple measures like painting rails white are still used to try and prevent over-heating. After three people died in August 2020 when a train hit a landslip near Stonehaven in Aberdeenshire, Network Rail has developed new software to predict sudden, torrential rainfall. 'Significant changes' Nicola Morgan, who works for Network Rail in its Wales and Borders region, said there had been ""significant changes in recent years"", with stronger weather fronts and powerful storms. Her colleagues in the Cardiff operations centre use heat sensors and cameras to keep track of conditions around the region. This won't necessarily prevent disruption to services, but can flag anything unsafe. Measures like speed restrictions can be introduced, and maintenance teams alerted. Drones can now be sent to see what's going on. Melting and flooding roads Major roads can also be severely affected by extreme weather. Angela Halliwell, who works for National Highways, said ""we had some instances last year where some pockets of the road did soften or in some cases melt."" At the same time, ""we have noticed an increase in surface water flooding through the intense rainfall"". New drainage standards have been brought in ""in line with future climate projections"", Ms Halliwell said. To try and make roads more resilient to heat, different surfacing is being introduced which would not ""melt or rut, potentially crack or joint"", Weather extremes also exacerbate every driver's nemesis: potholes. Sir John Armitt says ultimately, ""we get the infrastructure we pay for"". While Network Rail's Martin Frobisher thinks the changing climate will be ""the biggest challenge for this century"".",Liberal
BBC,"Climate change: Is the UK on track to meet its net zero targets? The UK has pledged to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050. Net zero means a country takes as much of these planet-warming gases - such as carbon dioxide - out of the atmosphere as it puts in. In March, the government released a new net zero strategy, after a court ruled its previous plan did not contain enough detail about how its climate targets would be met. But the government's independent advisers, the Climate Change Committee (CCC), have called the UK's efforts ""worryingly slow"". The cost of delivering net zero - and who pays for it - has sparked a political debate. The CCC estimates it will require an extra £50bn of investment per year, by 2030. What progress is being made? The UK has been successful in cutting carbon emissions from electricity generation so far. These have fallen by around three-quarters since 1990. This is due to a declining use of fossil fuels - coal, oil and gas - for electricity. Meanwhile the proportion of electricity generated by renewables - like wind and solar - has grown to around 40% in the last few years, up from just over 10% a decade ago. The government has pledged that all of the UK's electricity will come from low carbon sources (renewables and nuclear) by 2035. The government plans to increase offshore wind capacity five-fold by 2030, increase solar power capacity five-fold by 2035, and approve up to eight new nuclear reactors. However, reports by the CCC, the National Audit Office and a cross-party group of MPs have warned that the UK risks missing its target, without clearer planning and much faster action. Despite the push for more renewable energy, the government is granting 100 oil and gas production licences for the North Sea. It says it wants to reduce the UK's reliance on imported energy - such as gas - from ""hostile states"" and says some fossil fuels will still be needed when net zero is reached. But the CCC says investing in renewables would be a better way to reduce reliance on imports and bring bills down for consumers. It says the expansion of fossil fuel production ""is not in line with net zero"". The UK still relies heavily on fossil fuels for its total energy needs. Total energy use includes electricity, but also things like petrol cars and gas heating. Buildings account for about 17% of the UK's greenhouse gas emissions, mainly due to burning fossil fuels for heating. The government has committed to installing 600,000 heat pumps a year by 2028 to replace gas boilers. Heat pumps use electricity rather than gas, and are around three times more efficient than a boiler. The government is offering grants of £5,000 to help homeowners in England and Wales install a heat pump. In 2022, around 70,000 heat pumps were installed in the UK, leaving the government's 600,000 target ""significantly off track"", according to the CCC. The UK has some of the least energy-efficient homes in Europe. Insulation is one of the most effective ways to reduce emissions from housing. The government has introduced the Great British Insulation Scheme to help insulate around 300,000 of the poorest-performing homes but the CCC says it needs to go further. Transport (not including aviation and shipping) accounted for just under a quarter of UK emissions in 2022, making it the largest emitting sector. The government says no new fully petrol and diesel cars will be sold from 2030. By 2028, it wants 52% of car sales to be electric. In 2022, nearly 17% of car sales were electric. This is ahead of schedule, according to the CCC. The government wants 300,000 publicly-accessible charging points for electric cars by 2030. The number of public charging points increased to around 37,000 in 2022 - up by nearly a third from 2021. But the rate of deployment will have to rise further, the CCC says. The government has allocated nearly £300m for up to 1,400 zero-emission buses through regional schemes, but the CCC says it needs to confirm when it will end the sale of diesel buses. The government aims to remove all diesel-only trains by 2040, but the CCC says it needs a clearer plan to achieve this. Overall, the CCC says there has been ""little progress"" switching to lower carbon modes of travel, such as public transport and active travel, to reduce car demand. Flying makes up about 7% of overall UK emissions, and shipping about 3%. The UK has a strategy for delivering net zero aviation by 2050. It has been criticised for relying too much on technologies such as sustainable fuels and zero emissions aircraft that do not yet exist. As a result, the CCC says that the government should be looking at how to manage demand rather than allowing it to grow - for example addressing private jet use and providing lower cost rail travel. It says there should be no net airport expansion across the UK. Progress has also been slow to establish a strategy to decarbonise shipping, the CCC says. Agriculture and land use produce 11% of the UK's greenhouse gas emissions. The government released its food strategy in June 2022, but the CCC criticised it for failing to deliver action to drive down emissions from agriculture at the required scale or pace. It has also been criticised for not doing more to encourage a switch to a more sustainable diet - eating plant-based foods, for example. Meat consumption in the UK has been falling though - down 17% in the last decade. In February 2023, the government released details of its long-awaited environmental land management schemes for England, replacing the EU common agricultural policy. The schemes mean farmers can apply for public money to support activities that benefit the environment. Trees and peatlands play important roles in removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. UK forest cover is 13%, among the lowest in Europe. The government has a target to plant 30,000 hectares of trees a year by 2025. However, annual UK tree planting has not risen above 15,000 hectares since 2001. The UK forestry body has warned that there is ""zero chance"" of the UK meeting its target. It is estimated that only around 20% of UK peatlands are in a near-natural state, including only 1.3% in England. These damaged peatlands are responsible for around 5% of the UK's greenhouse gas emissions, whereas healthy peatlands would take up carbon dioxide. The government aims to restore around 29,000 hectares of peatland a year across England, Scotland and Wales by 2025. But current levels are less than half this, leaving peatland restoration ""significantly off track"", the CCC says. Hydrogen is a low-carbon fuel that could be used for transport, heating, power generation or energy storage. The government says it considers hydrogen to be a critical part of future energy security and decarbonisation. It wants to have a 10GW hydrogen production capacity by 2030. The industry is in its infancy, and the government admits it will need ""rapid and significant scale-up"" in the coming years. The government has promised a decision on the role of hydrogen in heating by 2026, but the CCC says this delay is holding back potential investment. In March 2023 the government announced the first winning projects from the £240m Net Zero Hydrogen Fund. The ability to capture carbon before it is released - or take it out of the atmosphere and store it - will be important if the UK is to reach net zero. The government is aiming to capture and store between 20 and 30 million tonnes of CO2 a year by 2030. The Chancellor recently announced £20bn in investment in carbon capture over the next 20 years, and several projects have been announced. But the technology is still emerging and is expensive, and can only capture a portion of emissions. Industrial emissions represent about 14% of the UK total. The government aims to cut emissions from manufacturing by about two-thirds by 2035. It has a scheme to cap the amount of emissions allowed by individual sectors each year, reducing that amount over time. But the scheme risks companies shifting production to other countries and therefore not actually reducing their emissions. Small facilities, representing around 40% of industrial emissions, are not included in the scheme. The government is also under pressure to respond to the green investment packages announced by the US and EU over the past year.",Liberal
BBC,"How is sign language adapting to climate change? For deaf children, teachers and scientists, talking about things like ""greenhouse gases"" or ""carbon footprint"" used to mean spelling out long, complex scientific terms, letter by letter. Now they are among 200 environmental science terms that have their own new official signs in British Sign Language (BSL). The deaf scientists and sign language experts behind the update hope the new vocabulary will make it possible for deaf people to fully participate in discussions about climate change, whether it's in the science lab or classroom. ""We're trying to create the perfect signs that visualise scientific concepts,"" explains Dr Audrey Cameron. Dr Cameron, who is profoundly deaf, leads the sign language project at Edinburgh University, which has just added the new terms to the BSL dictionary. She described how, in her own scientific career, a lack of vocabulary meant she was excluded from important meetings and conversations. ""I was involved in research for 11 years and went to numerous meetings but was never was truly involved because I couldn't understand what people were saying,"" she told BBC News. ""I wanted to talk with people about chemistry and I just wasn't able to."" Glasgow-based biology teacher Liam McMulkin has also been involved in the sign-creation workshops, hosted by the Scottish Sensory Centre. ""The beauty of sign language - particularly for science - is that it's a visual language,"" he explained. ""Some of the concepts are abstract, but sign language can really help children to understand them."" Mr McMulkin used the sign for ""photosynthesis"" as an example, which uses one flat hand-shape to represent a leaf, while projecting the fingers - like the sun's rays - from other hand. ""When I do this [move the sun hand towards the leaf hand], you can see that the energy is being absorbed by the leaf,"" he explained. The science glossary project, funded in part by the Royal Society, has been running since 2007 and has added about 7,000 new signs to BSL. Describing the process by which signs are developed, Dr Cameron explained: ""We take a list of terms from the school curriculum and then work together to come up with something accurate but also visual of the meaning."" The newest signs are themed around biodiversity, ecosystems, the physical environment and pollution. There is an online video video glossary demonstrating the terms. Missing words The glossary is designed to support deaf children in schools. And as 13-year-old Melissa, a deaf student at a mainstream school in Glasgow explained: ""they really help you understand what's happening."" Melissa showed me the difference between laboriously finger-spelling greenhouse gases (G-R-E-E-N-H-O-U-S-E G-A-S-E-S), and using the new sign that includes moving her closed fists around like gas molecules in the air. ""With the sign I can see something is happening with the gas,"" she said. Mr McMulkin, who is Melissa's science teacher and is also profoundly deaf, added that hearing people were ""constantly learning and acquiring knowledge"" wherever they go, ""but deaf people miss out on so much information"". ""That's why it's so important to use sign language in science lessons in schools,"" he said. ""It allows deaf children to learn in their natural language."" Dr Cameron also highlighted the value in education of depicting intricate scientific concepts in hand movements - for both hearing and deaf children. Dr Cameron recalled observing a class in which five-year-olds were learning about how things float or sink. ""They were learning about how things that are less dense will float, which is quite complex,"" she explained. ""And the teacher was using the sign for 'density'."" The sign explains that concept by using one closed fist and wrapping the other hand around it - squeezing and releasing to represent different densities. ""I thought - these five-year-olds are not going to get this. But some time after the end of the lesson, they were asked a question about why things float or sink and they all used the sign for density,"" Dr Cameron said. ""So I've seen how much of an impact this can have. And my passion has just grown as the glossary has grown."" Prof Jeremy Sanders, chair of the Royal Society diversity and inclusion committee, said: ""We hope these new signs will inspire and empower the next generation of BSL-using students and allow practising scientists to share their vital work with the world.""

WSJ,"Climate-related risks are becoming an increasing challenge for insurers, the U.S. Treasury Department said, urging state regulators to step up their so-far “limited” efforts to address the issue. Insurers face a host of risks, from increased litigation to reputational harm, associated with climate change, but the response from regulators remains in its early stages, the Treasury Department’s Federal Insurance Office said in a report published Tuesday. Efforts by insurance regulators to tackle climate risk should be “deepened and broadened,” Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said. Insurance in the U.S. is regulated at the state level, an approach that has led to a fragmented policy landscape nationwide. More frequent severe weather events have made insurers’ climate-related policies a bread-and-butter issue for households across the country. State Farm recently stopped issuing new home insurance policies altogether in California, in reaction to wildfire risk and construction cost inflation. Allstate also paused the issuance of new policies in the state.  That kind of industry pullback is being seen across the U.S. American International Group is planning curbs on home-insurance sales to affluent customers in about 200 ZIP Codes at high risk of floods or wildfires, people familiar with the matter told The Wall Street Journal earlier this month. Farmers Group this year stopped offering new home insurance policies in hurricane-prone Florida.  After adjusting for inflation, eight of the 10 costliest U.S. wildfires have occurred since 2017, according to the FIO. The U.S. in 2022 saw 18 climate-related disasters that cost more than $1 billion each, the office said. Though the FIO can’t force states to adopt its recommendations, it has an oversight role. The office urged state regulators to push insurers to expand their focus and look at the longer time horizon associated with climate-related risks. The office said insurers face a number of climate-related risks, including their extensive exposure to real estate both through their investment portfolios and the policies they issue. It warned that increased claims payouts could present liquidity risks to some insurers. The FIO also noted that insurers face a risk of increased litigation for alleged failures to address climate risks, and possible reputational damage for insuring or investing in carbon-intensive sectors. Financial institutions generally have faced pressure from activists and activist investors to withdraw their services from carbon-emitting industries. The report added that some state regulators are taking meaningful steps to look at climate-related risks.

WSJ,"When Norman Weizineau fled the wildfires threatening the village where he has lived his whole life, his biggest worry was wildlife, such as moose, which is a staple of the community’s diet. “Maybe it won’t taste as good because of the smoke,” he said. He and about 400 other residents of a nearby First Nation reserve settled into a hotel here and expressed concern about how the land around them is changing. It is warmer, and water levels are lower than in the past, many said, making for poor hunting and tricky boating. Weizineau, 57 years old, said that he’s experienced forest fires before. However, “it was in the forest; now it is all around the reserve. I have never been evacuated before.” Scientists, firefighters and residents of remote communities such as Weizineau are experiencing a transformation of the vast green expanse of woods and wildlife into a tinderbox that can explode under the right conditions. They are seeing changes to the ecosystem that scientists link to a warming climate. Ecologists who’ve spent years in the field studying the forest say they see new swings of extreme rainfall followed by drought in the region, an expanding range of insect pests that are making forests more susceptible to fire, and shifts in the rich soils and permafrost that absorb and store carbon from the atmosphere. These changes are now combining with past fire management practices that some critics say have worsened this year’s conflagration. The Canada fires forced tens of thousands of people to flee, sent choking plumes of yellow haze from Vermont to South Carolina and led health authorities to warn residents to stay indoors because of high levels of harmful particulates in the atmosphere along the entire Atlantic seaboard. As of Monday, 12.1 million acres had burned this season across 12 of Canada’s 13 provinces and territories. In Quebec alone, usually by this time in the fire season an average of 5,469 acres would have burned. This year, that figure has already surpassed 1.8 million acres, according to the Canadian government. “The pattern of a rapid onset of drought, considerable wildfire and then air quality impacts associated with it are all consistent with global warming,” said Justin Mankin, a climate scientist at Dartmouth College, and co-lead of the drought task force at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. “This is a pattern we’ve seen in the West.” One creeping impact of a warming climate is the northward expansion of insects that can threaten the forests, ecologists say. Kaysandra Waldron said colleagues at the Laurentian Forestry Centre were hiking in a grove of black spruce several hours from Quebec City on the North Shore area in 2021 when they discovered a large area of dead trees. The researchers believe the trees were killed by a combination of drought and infestation by spruce budworm, a caterpillar moth that usually attacks poplar and fir trees further south. The trees’ bud break is occurring earlier in the spring now, giving the larvae more food to eat when they emerge from winter, according to ecologists. “Normally you can see that insect in balsam fir stands, but now we are starting to see a large amount of black spruce that literally died in the last few years,” said Waldron, a research scientist for Natural Resources Canada. Canadian forestry officials say that the spruce budworm is the most destructive insect of coniferous forests in North America, able to consume 85 percent of a tree’s leaves. In Western Canada, forests have faced a long-term assault from the bark-eating mountain pine beetle, which killed pine trees in a 45-million-acre area since the early 1990s through 2015, according to Canadian government statistics. While insect-ravaged trees become fuel for fire, it is still unclear if the pine beetle infestation made forest fires worse there, said Allan Carroll, a professor of forest sciences at the University of British Columbia. Some studies suggest there has been no difference in the intensity of fires in beetle-infested regions, because the dead trees don’t provide a canopy for the fire to spread. This month’s fires across Canada are most likely burning hotter and longer today because firefighters stopped previous blazes, leaving bigger untouched areas for new fires to burn, Carroll said. In British Columbia, Ellen Whitman, a research scientist for the Canadian Forest Service, spent last week trapped by a fire at her home on Vancouver Island. She’s hoping to eventually get back to a long-term forest site in the Northwest Territories. As forest fires become more frequent, long-lived trees such as black spruce are being replaced with shorter-lived, faster-growing trees such as aspen and birch, according to a 2019 study Whitman published in the journal Scientific Reports. This change in tree species is altering the animals that live there (woodland caribou replaced by deer and bison) and releasing long-sequestered carbon, sometimes turning the boreal forest into a carbon source, rather than a sink that helps keep global greenhouse gases in check. Old-growth trees and the deeper organic soils they grow on are able to store carbon longer than short-lived ones such as poplars. Forest fires in northern forests are starting to accelerate permafrost thaw, releasing methane and CO2 that worsen global climate warming. This has also been documented recently in Alaska. Whitman lived through big fire seasons in western Canada, but she’s never experienced anything like this year. More than 13 times the average amount of land for this time of year has burned across Canada. “All of this together is quite overwhelming,” Whitman said. “As a researcher and a scientist, we’ve been ringing the alarm bell about climate change and fire activity for years, but seeing years like this is personally quite difficult.” The danger is also rising in places such as the U.S.’s Upper Midwest, where parts of Michigan and Wisconsin are seeing their highest fire danger risk on record, said Jim Wallmann, meteorologist with the National Interagency Fire Center in Boise, Idaho. A major problem for Michigan this year is how widespread fires have been throughout Canada, which saps resources from provincial authorities that might be able to help U.S. colleagues. In the 1980s, authorities from Wisconsin, Minnesota and Michigan banded together to create the Great Lakes Forest Fire Compact, which eventually included the Canadian provinces of Ontario and Manitoba, to prevent fires and to share resources in the event of a fire. The international coalition is based on the notion that when one member is in trouble, they can use the resources of other members. But that notion is in question this season. “A lot of us are in the same boat at the same time; that makes it difficult to share resources,” said Kerry Heckman, spokeswoman for Michigan’s Department of Natural Resources. “From my experience the compact is stretched more thin.” Wildfires are part of the natural cycle of any forest, but it is the scale that is expanding as the climate warms, according to Mankin. Eastern North America still has more precipitation than the West, and he said eastern fires won’t burn as long. However, predicting how and when precipitation falls as snow and rain is becoming less clear, he said. “Climate change is both unfolding rapidly in the form of large, systematic changes in droughts, floods, heat waves and the like, but it is also kind of unfolding slowly, in that we have our hands on the lever,” Mankin said. “It is our emissions of greenhouse gases that’s kind of determining how bad the climate problem becomes.” Mandy Gull-Masty, Grand Chief of the Crees, said elders have warned her for decades about changes in wind and rain patterns, wildlife behavior and snowfall. “My members are really the canary in the coal mine and have been sounding the alarm on these issues long before we see the impacts in cities,” said Gull-Masty, who is from the northern Quebec Cree community of Waswanipi. “Because we are the front-line people with the forest on a daily basis.”",Liberal
WSJ,"Agriculture faces some daunting challenges from a changing climate in coming years, scientists project. Heavy rainfall is expected to become more frequent, with resulting erosion of soil decreasing available nutrients. Growing conditions are forecast to change regionally—with some places seeing a potentially longer growing season, but others seeing drier, colder ones. Disease-causing pests and insects are expected to expand their range. Growers soon could turn to new technological solutions to help cope. Here are a few of the latest. Wildfires have become bigger and more frequent as the climate has warmed, sometimes leaving hard-to-reach mountainsides razed of vegetation. As a possible solution for bringing slopes back to life, scientists envision tree seeds dropped by drone. Lining Yao, a mechanical engineer and materials designer at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh and a team of scientists have come up with a surprisingly low-tech device to help make sure that seeds dropped by drone germinate into saplings. These seed carriers with curved tails and a tightly coiled stem are made of paper-thin sheets of wood and attached to a seedpod. When rainwater touches the tails, the material swells, propping up the seed carrier with its point facing into the soil. Seeds with tails had at least 80% success rate burying in lab tests, Yao and her colleagues showed in a study published in February in the journal Nature. The researchers tested seeds of different sizes, including those of the whitebark pine, a high-altitude conifer that grows in regions of Western U.S. where wildfires are expected to increase. The team has had conversations with groups interested in aerial seeding, and is looking for partners for mass-manufacture and pilot tests. “The bottleneck is to really scale up the manufacturing side of things,” Yao says. A network of sensors for plants might help extend the life of farmers’ crops. Small, flexible sensors placed on plants’ leaves could monitor how a crop is coping with environmental stressors, from hot, dry spells to a lack of nutrients due to soil elements washed away in heavy rain, says Yong Zhu, a mechanical engineer at North Carolina State University. Zhu is part of a team that built and demonstrated sensors that can gather information such as hydration and temperature in plants and their immediate environment, as well as chemical hormones released by the plant in response to infection or environmental stress. Made of silver, gold, and carbon nanomaterials embedded in a flexible polymer, the sensors were able to detect infection in tomato plants within four days, the team reported in a study published in the journal Science Advances in April. Such sensors could provide a personalized report plant-by-plant to a farmer, allowing for precise delivery of water or fertilizer only when a plant needs it, says Qingshan Wei, a chemical engineer at NCSU who worked with Zhu. The current design is limited: The polymer hardens when exposed to the sun, and the setup is connected by wires to a computer and juiced by an external power supply. Future versions could be made of cheap, hardy, biodegradable materials that are solar powered, and wirelessly transmit environmental data, the team says.  Farmers reap big rewards when their crops are pollinated by bees. But pollinator populations are declining, while climate change is shifting the bloom seasons that bees depend on to shore up food stores through the cold season, and causing harsher winters. When temperatures drop, bees retreat to the hive and rely on their stored food, but if they run out, or cluster in a corner of the hive too far from the store, they can starve to death. A team of roboticists in Europe hopes to change this. The team has built a device that monitors bee colony temperatures during the winter within wooden boxed hives used in agriculture. Thermal sensors and heating elements are built into a beehive frame, and covered in a wooden layer with a hexagonal pattern coated in melted beeswax to encourage bees to build on it.  Researchers warmed the bees when they became static and gathered in a cluster during winter, and directed them to a food source at a different location by heating that section of the hive, the team reported in a March study published in Science Robotics. It was a partial success, says study author Rob Mills, a roboticist studying animal behavior at EPFL in Switzerland: Though the queen didn’t survive, worker bees survived two months longer than she did that season. The hives aren’t ready for prime-time. For one, they are expensive to build outside a lab facility, and need an external power source to keep them humming. In soaking humidity or searing heat, growers in over 40 countries are farming produce in high-tech containers made by the Boston company Freight Farms. Leafy greens like lettuce and kale, and roots like turnips and radish grow in specially designed vertical rows, lit with LEDs, and monitored closely for nutrition, water acidity, temperature, and more, according to David Harris, the company’s director of crop research and development. Over two-thirds of all freshwater used globally goes to farming. In many places, climate change is expected to keep water in short supply even as demand increases. In a twist, growing plants in water instead of soil—what’s known as hydroponic farming—could ease the crunch because it uses less water overall. Compared with field lettuce grown in Arizona, lettuce in the containers use about 0.3% of water per head, the company estimates. And Harris says the farms use almost zero added water in humid regions like Puerto Rico. But the energy used to run the containers is a hurdle to wide adoption, Harris says. The units on average use about 170-270 kilowatt hours of energy a day, more than 5 times the amount used by the average American consumer. It is currently cheaper to grow some plants like corn in fields, Harris says. And, some high-tech farming companies are reporting cooling interest from investors. “In 20-30 years, if we started to see some industrial scale corn farming in hydroponic systems, that would not surprise me at all,” Harris says, as higher temperatures begin pushing farming in some places indoors. As growing seasons shift with climate change, fruit may be ready sooner than growers expect.  Enter the robots. Tevel, based in Israel, has created a swarm of fruit-picking robots that could lend a few spare hands when fruits ripen unpredictably soon and risk spoiling on the tree, according to Ittai Marom, U.S. general manager at Tevel. A platform on wheels serves as the base for a group of eight robots, which each have a picking arm ending in a gripper. As the platform rolls through an orchard, the robots fly up to tree branches, identify ripe fruit, pick it from the tree, and deposit them on a platform. There are cameras on the robot and Tevel’s software identifies ripe fruit after analyzing the color and size. “Somebody who is today a team leader of a picking crew, in the near future might find themselves monitoring a robotic picker from the convenience of an air-conditioned pickup truck,” Marom says. As part of a handful of collaborations, the robots have harvested apples in Italy and Chile, and peaches, nectarines and plums in California. There is room for improvement on speed—for now people are still faster at gathering fruit off the trees, Marom says.",Liberal
WSJ,"With the rise of ChatGPT and other artificial intelligence chatbots, AI is everywhere, from your doctors office to your brokerage account. It’s also poised to shake up another hot sector of the economy: clean energy. Among those tracking this closely is Amy Francetic, co-founder of Buoyant Ventures, an $81 million venture capital fund founded in 2020 focused on digital applications, including AI, for climate technology. Her journey to climate technology started off in an entirely different arena: children’s software. At Hasbro in the 1990s, she helped produce software for Mr. Potato Head and Candy Land games. She later founded a children’s software company that she sold to Lego. Now, Francetic is focusing on digital technology used for clean energy. About half of the companies Buoyant invests in use some form of artificial intelligence, she says. From Raptor Maps, which uses AI and drones to more efficiently manage farms of solar panels, to ReelData, which uses AI to optimize the growth of fish (think cameras in giant tanks), Buoyant’s portfolio features cutting-edge startups that could help shape the energy transition. We recently caught up with Francetic to ask her about what she sees for AI’s future in climate tech. Can you tell me how you went from designing software for Mr. Potato Head to investing in AI for climate change? It wasn’t an immediate next step. I’ve always been comfortable at the intersection of business and technology. Early in my career, I founded a high-tech company called Zowie and sold it to Lego. Then I did some work at Stanford on fuel cells. I had a health scare and thought to myself, I wanted to work on something that meant something to me, that had some purpose and would make the world a better place. That led me to clean energy. I started a technology accelerator called the Clean Energy Trust and ran it for seven years. That informed my point of view of how to make money in this space. And that’s what led me to software [for clean energy]. That’s what I know. I’m not a battery scientist, I’m not a chemist. I’m a digital-technology expert. What are some qualities in companies Buoyant looks to invest in? We’re looking for companies that have some measurable climate benefit. We have to be convinced that they can deliver that. About half the companies in our portfolio use AI to some degree. When people think about taking on climate change, they typically think of big physical infrastructure and gear like solar farms, windmills, geothermal and of course electric vehicles. How does AI fit into the climate-solution puzzle? A lot of what makes that infrastructure work well is software and digital solutions–whether that’s stitching together the infrastructure or making it more cost-effective. That’s the opportunity for software and AI to create efficiencies on top of that infrastructure. Your career in clean energy has spanned several cycles, from the brief heyday of the late 2000s to the drought of the early 2010s. Can you talk a bit about that journey and how it’s perhaps changed in the past few years? It wasn’t fashionable. Now it’s fashionable. A number of things have happened since the late 2000s. Back then a lot of these companies that were being funded were the kind that took a lot of capital. There wasn’t a lot of capital to fund those companies in the later stages. The businesses were dying before they could get to commercial success. We’ve also had global consensus around climate change. The effects of climate change are so widely felt. That has created more of a global market for a lot of these technologies as well as global funders. There’s a record amount of capital invested in climate. This is the go-go time. It’s a great time to be making money in this space. A wave of cash is coming from government programs such as the Inflation Reduction Act. How is that affecting the investment environment? The funds being deployed to speed up the transition to electric vehicles are really exciting. It creates more opportunities for software to figure out where to site infrastructure, where to put the chargers, how to manage the payments across different types of cars. We’re excited about fleet management more than passenger vehicles. There can be tremendous emission reductions if you start to transition those fleets to electric. Tell me about Raptor Maps, which says it helps solar farms operate more efficiently. How does it do that and how does AI fit in? They began as drones that flew over solar farms. The way this used to work, solar farms had to be inspected, and it had to be done on foot. When you think about how large these solar farms have gotten, you can see how long that would take. Now you can fly a drone over the farm in a day and take video. The cameras and sensors on the drones can determine which panels may be underperforming. They’ve created software products that will help manage the maintenance of the panels. One of the cool things they’re working on now, and a great example of AI: You can install a drone at a docking station at the solar site, someone controls the drone remotely and it can produce an ungodly amount of data. The operators use AI to tell them how to make sense of it. Any time you’re dealing with large data sets, AI is very good at digesting that data and returning recommendations to customers. One of the companies in your portfolio, ReelData, has a unique approach to fish farming. How does that work? We’ve overfished our oceans. The way that people farm fish, they farm salmon in pens off the coast in the ocean. That creates a lot of environmental problems, hurts biodiversity and creates pollution. Land-based aquaculture is a new way to produce fish that’s taking hold. They use these giant pens in warehouses. The biggest cost of producing fish in these pens is food. ReelData uses AI and cameras installed in the pens to figure out how to optimize the feeding of the fish. It reduces the food cost. A lot of farmers are overfeeding the fish. Their AI is making these systems more profitable. They’re also figuring out when to harvest the fish. They’re using facial recognition for fish! They can track the growth of that fish and say, it’s time to harvest. So-called virtual power plants, in which household energy resources can be tapped to supply power to the grid, are getting a lot of chatter. Can you talk about what they are and how AI is a key part of them? One of your companies, Shifted Energy, seems to fit under the VPP umbrella. If you have solar panels on your home, if you’ve got a battery backup system, if you’ve got a heat pump, you can use that as a resource for the grid. You might be able to smooth out your demand profile. You might be able to use that solar power when energy prices are high. If you have extra energy, you can put that energy back into the grid. You could use your EV as an energy source. You have a bidirectional relationship to the grid. Shifted Energy is [managing supply and demand] for homeowners who have electric water heaters. They’re heating when renewable energy is available and when the price is cheapest. Their technology is also applicable to electric vehicles. It started in Hawaii where electricity prices are high and renewables have a very high penetration. This innovation was fine-tuned to serve lower income families. Now they’re deploying in California, Colorado, the Southeast.",Liberal
WSJ,"The biggest U.S. bank is making one of the biggest bets ever to remove carbon from the atmosphere as a way to fight climate change. JPMorgan Chase has agreed to invest more than $200 million to purchase credits from several companies in the nascent industry, company officials said. The money and JPMorgan’s endorsement are a boost to businesses that have removed only small amounts of carbon so far. JPMorgan is making the purchases to neutralize the bank’s environmental footprint. It is also attempting to score new business by becoming a leader in a burgeoning clean-energy industry. The bank helped carbon removal startup Climeworks raise $650 million from investors last year and has fielded questions from big corporate clients about carbon removal. “We’re jumping in the pool all in,” Brian DiMarino, JPMorgan’s head of operational sustainability, said in an interview. “This is us putting our weight and our capital behind something we believe is truly important to bring to market now.” Carbon removal is gaining increasing attention as it becomes clear that the transition away from fossil fuels is moving too slowly to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions enough to limit climate change. Scientists estimate billions of tons of removal will be needed annually by midcentury to avoid the worst effects of global warming. Critics say carbon removal could allow fossil-fuel producers to continue with business as usual. As the largest U.S. bank, JPMorgan is also among the largest financiers of both fossil fuels and clean energy. Its relationship with oil-and-gas companies has prompted criticism from climate activists. The bank has also been criticized by Republicans for giving priority to environmental, social and corporate governance—or ESG—factors. West Virginia banned JPMorgan from doing business with the state last year, arguing that ESG amounted to a boycott on the state’s coal industry. JPMorgan said the move was “disconnected from the facts” and “anti-free market.” The bank will purchase credits tied to the removal of 800,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide from several startups including paying more than $20 million to Climeworks, a Swiss company that recently delivered the industry’s first verified carbon removals through a process called direct-air capture, which sucks carbon out of the air using giant fans so it can be buried underground. Climeworks will remove 25,000 metric tons over nine years. Getting support from a financial powerhouse is validating after much of the sector’s initial support came from technology companies, carbon-removal executives said. “It’s a big shot in the arm for us to go scale up our operations,” said Peter Reinhardt, chief executive of startup Charm Industrial, which turns plant waste into a carbon-rich liquid that can be injected underground. Reinhardt said JPMorgan’s purchases should help Charm raise money and reduce costs. The company has removed about 6,000 tons to date. JPMorgan is buying nearly 30,000 tons of removal from Charm over five years. The bank is also committing to match its operational emissions from directly consuming natural gas and other fuels with equivalent carbon removals by 2030, one of the first such pledges by a major company. JPMorgan is aiming to reduce those emissions 40% by 2030 from 2017 levels. Big companies use a combination of emissions reduction and carbon removal to meet their climate goals. Carbon-removal companies are attracting billions of dollars in government funding. The U.S. is expected to announce the recipients of $3.5 billion in funding for direct-air capture hubs around the country this summer. Climeworks has three applications in for that funding as part of a recent U.S. expansion, chief marketing officer Julie Gosalvez said. Last year’s Inflation Reduction Act includes tax credits for direct-air capture that Goldman Sachs analysts estimate could cover nearly half the cost of certain projects. JPMorgan’s commitment to fund about 800,000 tons of removal is the second-largest purchase in the market’s history, according to data provider CDR.fyi. It would neutralize the annual emissions of roughly 160,000 passenger cars. In the sector’s largest-ever deal, Microsoft said last week it would pay for about 2.8 million tons of removal through a wood-chip-fired power station in Denmark operated by energy firm Ørsted. When trees and plants grow, they naturally absorb carbon. Capturing that carbon, then permanently storing it is one form of carbon removal. By agreeing to pay years in advance, companies like JPMorgan and Microsoft hope to accelerate the industry’s growth. They are willing to pay hundreds of dollars per ton for each removal credit to get the certainty that they are helping fight climate change. They also want to secure the credits they need to hit emissions targets. Removal credits can cost 100 times more than conventional carbon credits, some of which don’t benefit the planet. JPMorgan will still use some traditional credits as long as they are high quality while it increases its removal purchases, DiMarino said. The bulk of JPMorgan’s commitment—about 450,000 tons—is a preliminary 15-year agreement to purchase from CO280, a little-known startup. The company’s removal plans are roughly similar to those of Ørsted in that it aims to capture carbon absorbed by plants when biomass is used in industrial processes. If CO280 fails, the bank will pay for removal from other companies, DiMarino said. The rest of the roughly 800,000 tons will come through a carbon removal alliance of big companies called Frontier that includes Google parent Alphabet and Facebook parent Meta Platforms . As part of that, JPMorgan will provide its clients with access to up to $25 million in carbon removal credits while committing $50 million in purchases to neutralize its own emissions. Frontier last week separately said it would pay Charm for the removal of more than 110,000 tons.",Liberal
WSJ,"Global temperatures are likely to surge to record levels over the next five years and breach the 1.5 degrees Celsius threshold set out in the Paris climate agreement, scientists said in a new report. Warning that the world could be entering a new phase of climate change, researchers at the World Meteorological Organization, a U.N. agency, said there is a 66% likelihood that annual average global temperatures will exceed the threshold of 1.5 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels by 2027. “This report does not mean that we will permanently exceed the 1.5°C level specified in the Paris Agreement which refers to long-term warming over many years,” WMO Secretary-General Petteri Taalas said Wednesday. “However, WMO is sounding the alarm that we will breach the 1.5°C level on a temporary basis with increasing frequency.” Warming at those levels could have profound implications for health, food security and water management, he said. The Paris agreement in 2015, signed by more than 190 countries, set a goal of containing the rise in global temperatures to no more than 2 degrees Celsius, and preferably to no more than 1.5 degrees. Scientists see the 1.5 degrees Celsius limit as a key threshold in limiting the most dire consequences of climate change. “A warming El Niño is expected to develop in the coming months and this will combine with human-induced climate change to push global temperatures into uncharted territory,” Taalas said. El Niños are a weather pattern that typically reduce rain in parts of Asia while increasing precipitation in the Western U.S. and parts of South America. The predicted increase in global mean temperatures is moving the world “further and further away from the climate we are used to,” said Leon Hermanson, a meteorologist who led the report. In January, political and business leaders told the World Economic Forum’s annual meeting in Davos that enough isn’t being done to put the world on track to meet the 1.5-degree limit. “We feel that a global reset is needed,” said Sherry Rehman, minister of climate change for Pakistan, which was devastated by flooding last year and is expected to be one of the countries most vulnerable to climate change. Record temperatures have been reached in many parts of the world over the past year. In July, Britain recorded its highest-ever temperature of over 40 degrees Celsius (about 104 degrees Fahrenheit). A WMO report released in November showed that the last eight years have each been warmer than all years on record before that period.",Liberal
WSJ,"European glaciers lost a record amount of mass over the past two years from a one-two punch of below-normal snowfall and warmer temperatures, international climate scientists said. The retreating snowpack threatens supplies of freshwater to cities and farms throughout the Alps watershed, but it is also lengthening the region’s summer tourism season. The World Meteorological Organization, a scientific arm of the United Nations, said Friday that glaciers across Europe shrank from a combination of little winter snow and heat waves between May and September. In addition, dust blown from the Sahara in March 2022 landed on the snow, absorbing the sun’s rays and increasing the amount of melting, the report said. “Europe actually got hit hard both ways last year,” said Blair Trewin, a climate scientist at the WMO and an author of the new report. “They had an unusually dry winter, which meant that you didn’t have as much snow accumulating at high elevations as you normally would. But then they had a very hot summer as well.” For the first time since record-keeping began, no snow survived the summer melt season at some of the highest measurement sites. As a result, those glaciers lost their source of ice. Record temperatures were reported from the summit of Mont Blanc, the peak that straddles France and Italy. In Iceland and northern Norway, however, a cool summer led to more precipitation and a small gain in glacial mass, according to the report. In 2022, Switzerland’s glaciers lost 6% of their volume. Since 2001, those glaciers have shrunk by one-third, the report said. In July 2022, a weather balloon launched from Payerne, Switzerland, detected air temperature of 32 degrees Fahrenheit at 17,007 feet, the highest altitude in the 69-year records have been kept and only the second time that the height of the 32-degree freezing line exceeded 5,000 meters (16,404 feet), the report said.  The WMO report found that concentrations of atmospheric greenhouse gas reached record levels and contributed to warming of the land and ocean, melting ice sheets and glaciers, rising sea levels and acidifying oceans. These are the same conclusions reached in March in the latest report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. The WMO’s data set of 40 reference glaciers throughout the globe for which there are long-term observations lost an average of 4.3 feet from 2021 to 2022, much larger than the average loss over the past decade. Since 1970, this group of reference glaciers have lost nearly 100 feet of thickness, according to the report. Glaciers collect snowfall during the winter and release water during the spring and summer. Once the glacier is gone, residents lose a resource vital for drinking water, irrigation and the production of hydroelectricity, Dr. Trewin said. Dr. Trewin said seasonal forecasts suggest another warm summer in Europe lies ahead. “A lot of the ingredients are in place for an awfully large glacial melt in 2023,” he said. This past winter, many European ski resorts faced a tough season because of the lack of snow, forcing some to close or move to higher altitudes. For other businesses, the warming Alps mean a busier summer season. Euan Wilson runs mountain bike tours in some of the region’s iconic mountain passes. Snow-covered trails that used to require waiting until August or September to be clear are now accessible in July. “You can definitely see the difference,” said Mr. Wilson, co-owner of H&I Adventures, based in Inverness, Scotland. “You can keep your guides busier and generate more income, but it comes with a massive downside which is climate change.”",Liberal
WSJ,"A United Nations panel of scientists said there is a “feasible, but narrow pathway” to avoid the worst effects of climate change, however to do so, the world’s nations must together cut greenhouse-gas emissions 60% by 2035 to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius over preindustrial levels. That level of cuts would require a massive and rapid shift in the world’s energy supply that is under way in some countries, but has been stifled by the war in Ukraine, the global energy crisis and thirst for economic growth in countries like China and India. Global greenhouse-gas emissions reached record levels in 2022 and are projected to continue their upward trajectory, according to scientists. The U.N.’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change on Monday released a synthesis of the Sixth Assessment Report, which combines three working-group studies on climate science, adaptation and mitigation, as well as special reports on the oceans, land and reaching 1.5 degrees Celsius, the number that nations agreed to limit warming at the 2015 Paris climate summit to avoid the worst effects of climate change. The synthesis was released at an IPCC meeting in Interlaken, Switzerland, and will be the panel’s last report until 2027. The authors state that the climate-related effects are worse than had been projected in the IPCC’s Fifth Assessment released in 2014, and that future effects will include more heat waves, periods of drought, extreme rainfall, sea level rise and flooding across the globe. These effects are the result of more than a century of burning of fossil fuels, which has led global temperatures to rise 1.1 degrees Celsius since 1900, the panel said. “The report shows that climate impacts are undermining our livelihoods, they are damaging the global economy and the impacts threaten our life support system, that of nature itself,” said Dr. Hoesung Lee, chairman of the IPCC, at a news conference Monday announcing the synthesis report. The report does have some good news. If nations are able to balance emissions and removals of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases to achieve a “net-zero” state sometime around the middle of the century, the Earth’s temperature could begin stabilizing a decade or so later, according to projections released in the IPCC synthesis report. That is a more positive outcome than in previous studies, according to Dr. Benjamin Poulter, an earth scientist at the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md., who is an author on Monday’s IPCC report and the previous one. “The quicker we act, the quicker we can stop the climate impacts that are happening,” Dr. Poulter said. Other IPCC authors note that climate solutions—from switching to electric vehicles to changing farming practices—are becoming cheaper and more available to the industrialized world and developing nations. Climate solutions also may have side benefits, according to Francis X. Johnson, a senior research fellow at the Stockholm Environment Institute and an IPCC report author. “Changes in society have benefits for the climate, but they have other benefits as well,” Dr. Johnson said. “Focusing on those benefits could be a more promising strategy since most people have a hard time getting their head around it. This is a big issue.” Cutting industrial carbon emissions can also reduce unhealthful air pollution, while adding green space to cities can improve residents’ quality of life while absorbing rainfall and cooling the air at the same time, Dr. Johnson said. The IPCC report states that greenhouse gases are difficult to cut from some industrial processes, agriculture, aviation and shipping. As a result, those emissions will have to be counterbalanced by carbon dioxide removal methods, such as capturing carbon emissions from factories and storing them safely underground, using filters to scrub carbon dioxide directly from the air, or persuading farmers to capture more carbon in their fields. In addition to providing information about the current status of greenhouse gas levels, global temperatures and future projections, the IPCC report also describes the effects of climate change on societies that will suffer more than wealthier nations. In 2022, heat waves racked Europe, China and the western U.S., while Pakistan was devastated by widespread flooding that affected more than 33 million people and resulted in $30 billion in damage, according to the World Bank. Climate financing is needed to help developing nations both adapt to today’s extreme weather events as well as prepare for the future, according to Dr. Lee. “The path to a safer, more equitable and sustainable future for all requires three to six times the current amount of financing, but there are enough financial resources to rapidly reduce greenhouse-gas emissions,” said Dr. Lee. “It’s not just about the quantity of money. It’s also about how and where it is allocated.” The world’s two largest carbon emitters, China and the U.S., are continuing to rely on fossil fuels. China issued permits for two new coal-fired power plants a week in 2022, according to the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air in Finland. Last week, the Biden administration approved the $7 billion Willow oil-drilling project in Alaska.",Liberal
WSJ,"Methane produced by “cow burps” is one of the biggest sources of greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture. Researchers are studying ways to stifle these emissions, which could help slow global warming. Methane, like carbon dioxide, traps heat in the atmosphere, making it a potent greenhouse gas. The U.S. and more than other 100 countries have pledged to reduce methane emissions by at least 30% from 2020 levels by 2030. On Tuesday, Danone , one of the world’s largest dairy companies, said it would align itself with the pledge by cutting emissions of its fresh-milk suppliers. The methane from cow burps is generated by enteric fermentation, a process by which microbes in the stomachs of cattle help break down and digest plant material. The process releases methane as a byproduct, which the animals expel through belching. The United Nations estimates that food and agriculture are responsible for almost one-third of all greenhouse gas emissions. This includes farm-based activities, such as enteric fermentation, which accounts for about 5% of global greenhouse gases. The agrifood sector also encompasses pre- and post-farm activities, such as food shipping, as well as changes in land use, such as the clearing of forests for farms. A study in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences reviewed almost 100 strategies for curbing enteric emissions. It identified five that cut daily methane from livestock by an average of 21% without harming animal productivity, and three more that reduced emissions per unit of milk or meat by an average of 12% while actually improving animal productivity. One of the most studied options is Bovaer, a feed additive developed by Dutch chemical maker DSM. The compound has been shown to reduce emissions by an average of 30% in dairy cows and 45% in beef cattle. Researchers have also seen reductions by introducing oilseeds, such as canola, into livestock diets, and by encouraging cattle to graze on less mature grasses. Younger grasses are lower in fiber and easier to digest. The seemingly simple act of giving livestock more feed also pays dividends. A better-fed animal produces more meat and milk relative to any extra methane it may emit during digestion. Cattle aren’t always fed the right amount, according to the authors of the study, or may lack essential nutrients in their diets, which limits productivity. Despite the effectiveness of these strategies, some farmers may be reluctant to adopt them, according to the lead author of the study, Claudia Arndt of the International Livestock Research Institute. Changing established practices—whether it is buying new feeds or additives or reseeding pastures—can add to expenses. “The greater the extra costs per kg of milk, the greater the risk of years with negative income,” said Jan Dijkstra, of Wageningen University & Research in the Netherlands, author of a study on the economics of methane mitigation. Farmers’ willingness to embrace the techniques might depend on whether they are enticed or compelled to do so through incentives or regulations, according to Frank Mitloehner, an air quality specialist at the University of California, Davis. So far, U.S. government efforts to curb methane have largely focused not on agriculture but on the oil and gas industries, which are a smaller domestic source of the gas. California, the top milk-producing state, has set a goal on its own of reducing methane from dairy and livestock 40% below 2013 levels by 2030. The state’s clean air board says that enteric mitigation measures will likely be needed to achieve the goal. Regulatory approval for methane-reducing products could also could speed their adoption. Boaver, which has been cleared for use in more than 40 countries including the European Union, has been in the U.S. approval process for six years, according to Hugh Welsh, president of DSM North America. “The FDA is treating it as a drug, we believe it is more appropriately regulated as a feed ingredient,” he said. Said Dr. Mitloehner: “We know this is one of the additives that works, but it is not available in the U.S.” In response to a query about Bovaer, a spokesperson for the U.S. Food and Drug Administration said, “The FDA encourages new product development and is exploring innovative approaches for evaluating new animal products that may also have benefits for people and the environment.” A recent U.N. report proposed changes to the agrifood sector that could help meet the Paris Climate Agreement’s goal of limiting global warming to less than 2 degrees Celsius, and preferably 1.5 degrees Celsius. On-farm emissions cuts make up almost one-fifth of the recommended measures, with about 17% of them coming from efforts to reduce enteric methane. A gas’s impact on warming is measured by how well it traps heat and how long it stays in the atmosphere. Methane is more effective at trapping heat than CO2, but only lasts about 12 years in the atmosphere. CO2 can persist for centuries. Because methane is a high-impact but short-lived gas, cutting its emissions could have a relatively fast-acting effect on the pace of climate change. “Warming from methane does not accumulate over long periods of time,” said Dr. Arndt. “Thus, it makes it important to reduce emissions right now to limit global warming.”",Liberal
WSJ,"A California tech entrepreneur says he might move his plan to launch sunlight-reflecting particles into the atmosphere to the U.S. or another country, after Mexican officials blocked the project. “There is no law that prevents me from doing this,” said Luke Iseman, chief executive and founder of Make Sunsets. The startup had raised $750,000 in venture capital and other funds with the idea of selling “cooling credits” to U.S. firms, according to Mr. Iseman. He said any money raised from customers would be used to release sulfur dioxide into the stratosphere, with the idea that the particles—if spread across a wide area—would reflect sunlight away from the Earth and cool the atmosphere. The company promised that a “cooling credit” would offset the equivalent of a ton of carbon dioxide for a year. “I think the thing to do is to do it from the U.S. or a U.S. territory,” Mr. Iseman said. “Maybe that’s what I should have done from the start.” The so-called solar-geoengineering project launched one balloon in 2022 and was planning more launches this month from a site in the Mexican state of Baja California Sur. Critics of solar geoengineering say not enough is known about how the particles will interact with other chemicals in the atmosphere and whether there will be unintended environmental effects. On Jan. 13, Mexico’s Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources, or Semarnat, issued a statement saying it would prohibit the project from going forward. The agency said any large-scale projects—and those that are seemingly large scale but under development—involving solar geoengineering within Mexico would be halted. Mexico’s Semarnat said it opposes the launches because there are currently no international agreements that address or regulate solar geoengineering activities. In 2010, delegates to the United Nations Convention on Biodiversity agreed to a nonbinding moratorium on geoengineering, which permitted small-scale research. Mexico is a signatory to the convention, while the U.S. isn’t. “I expected and hoped for dialogue,” Mr. Iseman said from a small town in the Mexican state of Baja California Sur. “I’m surprised by the speed and scope of the response.” Mr. Iseman didn’t ask for permission from the local government or consult locals about the experiments, according to the Mexican government. Mr. Iseman said he launched a single weather balloon in April carrying several grams of sulfur dioxide, and that he was planning to launch several more balloons this month with larger amounts. He added that he was using weather balloons purchased online and sulfur dioxide from an industrial supplier. The Make Sunsets founder said he was disappointed by the Mexican government’s response and agreed to pull the plug on his effort. Mr. Iseman, who graduated from the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, said he started the project because he felt existing efforts were stalled by government inaction. He said he informally consulted with scientists about geoengineering, but devised the designs and plan on his own. Researchers who examined Make Sunsets’ plan said the small amount of sulfur dioxide carried by the weather balloons probably wouldn’t have resulted in much atmospheric cooling. At the same time, the researchers said the concept of solar geoengineering might have some merit once more research is conducted. Although much discussed, solar geoengineering has never been tested in the field, and it risks causing other effects in the atmosphere, according to climate scientists. A 2019 study by Harvard University scientists estimated that climate warming could be cut in half using reflective airborne particles. However, there might be unexpected reduction in rainfall in a small number of areas around the world, according to the study, published in the journal Nature Climate Change. In March 2021, a committee of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine recommended that the U.S. invest as much as $200 million in a new solar-geoengineering research program, subject to public input and with careful governance over outdoor experiments. In April 2021, a field experiment involving a balloon release over Sweden—designed by Harvard University researchers and funded by private philanthropists—was halted amid opposition by environmental and indigenous groups. Last year, Congress asked the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to develop a set of guidelines on solar-geoengineering research that will be issued this spring, according to an OSTP spokesperson. At the same time, the agency said the research guidelines aren’t a substitute for reducing greenhouse gases produced by industrial activity, gases that are rapidly warming the atmosphere, oceans and land, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. “The Biden-Harris Administration strongly affirms that immediate, sustained, and effective reductions of global greenhouse gas emissions, effective and responsible CO2 removal, coupled with robust adaptation, are required to slow the pace of climate change and limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius,” the OSTP spokesperson said. For his part, Mr. Iseman said he isn’t finished with solar geoengineering, a concept he says he learned about by listening to an audio version of “Termination Shock,” a 2021 sci-fi novel by author Neal Stephenson in which a billionaire launched sulfur particles into the atmosphere with cannons from a site near the Texas-Mexico border. “One of my dreams is that we could, in some distant future, grow Make Sunsets legally and responsibly,” Mr. Iseman said.",Liberal
Cav Daily,"Charlottesville City Council met Monday for their second hybrid meeting since 2019. The only item on the agenda for this meeting was consideration of a special-use permit to allow the conversion of an apartment complex on 14th Street into a hotel. During the public comment portion of the meeting, University lecturer Amanda Nelsen and students from University course Write Climate: Art and Engagement expressed concern about climate change. The students shared an artistic mural they have spent the past semester making. The mural is made up of postcards and uses color to depict surface temperature anomalies between 1880 and 2022. On the back of each postcard are statements written by community members documenting their feelings about climate change and its impact on Charlottesville. Third-year College student Johnny Lindberg, one of Nelson’s students, spoke for the class in presenting the piece to Council and called upon Council members to support a strong and comprehensive climate action policy to reduce the City’s carbon footprint. “Our mural visibly depicts the warming of our climate,” Lindberg said. “On the other side, each postcard, individually sewn together, expresses a community member’s feelings towards the climate crisis … our community members express feelings of anger, fear, anxiety, frustration, and sadness, but above all they express the need for change.” Council then considered a special use permit request to allow for a hotel on 207 14th Street NW, which is currently the location of a 21-building condominium. The developer hopes to renovate the existing building to create a 19-room hotel and one residential apartment. The proposed change would reduce the number of available rental housing units, but according to the applicant Bill Chapman, the conversion could generate $10,000 per month in tax revenue. Councilor Sena Magill expressed concern about the proposed special use permit as it could hinder the availability of already scarce housing in the Charlottesville area. Per a 2018 Housing Needs Assessment, 23 percent of Charlottesville renters are spending more than half of their income on rent — the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development says that affordable housing should cost no more than 30 percent of the household’s income. “I can’t in good conscience, while we are looking at such a huge housing crisis, vote to reduce housing stock,” Magill said. Council voted to deny the special use permit with Councilors Magill, Payne, and Mayor Snook in opposition to the permit and Councillor Pinkston and Vicemayor Wade in support of the permit. During the reports meeting — which occurs prior to the start of the formal Council meeting and allows Council members to hear updates from community organizations or City staff — the Thomas Jefferson Area Coalition for the Homeless gave a presentation. TJACH is an organization that aims to reduce homelessness through the coordination of regional resources. TJACH Executive Director Anthony Haro discussed local homelessness, including the Point-In-Time Count which counts the number of individuals in a city experiencing homelessness annually each January. According to Charlottesville’s January count, 228 individuals were living in emergency shelters, an increase from 144 in 2021. Haro voiced his belief that this is due to continued impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and lack of affordable housing in Charlottesville. Haro also remarked that the number of unsheltered people — homeless persons living outside — has remained roughly the same since 2010. The PIT count has reported that approximately 20 to 30 people are unsheltered each year, with Haro drawing attention to the city’s failure to address these individuals’ needs. “What it says is that there is a group of people living outside in our community that we have not significantly been able to address,” Haro said. In addition to hearing from TJACH, Council heard a presentation from Josh Powell, support services director of the Charlottesville-U.Va.-Albemarle County Emergency Communications Center on how citizens can access emergency services. According to Powell, citizens can access emergency services by calling or texting 9-1-1. Powell additionally noted the development of a new emergency services number — 9-8-8 — staffed with mental health crisis counselors for those dealing with a mental health crisis. Sonny Saxton, executive director of the Charlottesville-U.Va.-Albemarle County Emergency Communications Center, then provided details on the Marcus Alert system, created to comply with the Marcus David Peters Act which was signed into law by former governor Ralph Northam in Nov. 2020. According to Saxton, the goal of the Marcus Alert system is to allow emergency services to more easily identify individuals in mental health crises and provide them adequate help while minimizing interactions between law enforcement officers and those in crisis. Under the new procedure, the emergency response to a mental or behavioral health crisis will be analogous to the physical health response – allowing a person in crisis to contact a crisis care team via 9-8-8 or local number and receive aid from a mobile crisis team. City Council will convene again May 16.",Liberal
Cav Daily,"In collaboration with the University’s Repair Lab — which seeks to understand the relationship between climate change and racial injustice — students enrolled in HIST 4501 “The Climate Crisis” this spring semester have been searching the archives of the Albert and Shirley Small Special Collections Library for historical data on the rising housing prices in Norfolk and using this information to connect historical trends in the increase in real estate prices. The University’s Repair Lab has been conducting research over the last year pertaining to the effects of climate change on housing prices in Norfolk and the surrounding areas. Researchers have obtained this information through a combination of field research and historical analysis. The goal of this project is to use the expertise of their members to research and teach the causes and consequences of environmental injustice. At the start of the semester, Justin McBrien, history lecturer and post-doctoral research associate, had the desire to find a research project for his HIST 4501 class to work on. With his previous experience in environmental history and his connections to people in the field, McBrien decided to collaborate with the lab, seeing this as an opportunity for his students to be able to engage with the material outside of the classroom. The lab focuses on understanding climate gentrification. The lab operates through collaboration between various disciplines, including students and faculty involved in history, political science and environmental science. Climate gentrification is an issue where wealthy individuals in areas more at risk from climate disasters — such as flooding — relocate to low-income neighborhoods to avoid these disasters, and it is often experienced in the coastal areas of the U.S. Through this relocation, the housing prices increase in the area with an influx of residents and force some of the previous inhabitants out of their homes. According to McBrien, even the anticipation of the impacts of climate change can drive this gentrification. “One, there's the problem of unequal impacts of climate risks, but there’s also the response — the idea of adaptation, resilience, even like the production of new green spaces, these kinds of responses,” McBrien said. “In an attempt to anticipate the impacts of climate change, [the responses] can themselves drive gentrification and displacement. So what appears to be a great solution to dealing with the incoming impacts of climate change ends up creating a new form of gentrification.” In Virginia, the effects of climate gentrification are predominantly seen in Norfolk, which is in close proximity to both the Chesapeake Bay and the Elizabeth River. The Norfolk area experiences around 170 days of high tide flooding per year — a number that is projected to rise over the years to come, per a technical report from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. McBrien’s project is still early in its process, with the present focus on collection and archiving of historical and current data. While larger conclusions cannot be drawn regarding the complete effects of climate change on the Norfolk area at this stage of the project, some instances of inequality have been measured and can be used to further explore how the impacts of climate change relate to the increased aggression of gentrification in other areas. One of these instances of inequality is the increase in real estate prices in Liberty City — a predominantly Black and Latinx neighborhood in Miami that has been gentrified due to its increased elevation in comparison to the rest of the city. Gaby Vargas, third-year College student and intern for the University’s Environmental Justice Policy Clinic, emphasized that financial inequality plagues Norfolk residents during floods. Residents’ opinions will be incorporated in focus groups during the research portion of this project. “Flooding is a really big problem that [the Repair Lab] wants to focus on — specifically flooding within Black neighborhoods, where a lot of the solutions offered to residents of color aren't necessarily feasible,” Vargas said. “For flooding insurance, I believe that your house has to flood multiple times in order to qualify for it.” As McBrien observed while teaching this class, many students enjoy examining historical data — such as land deeds and other documents — in a manner that influences the world outside of the classroom in their collaboration with the Repair Lab. “I think what the most important thing that students are taking away from this is that this is holistically integrated into all of these other issues,” McBrien said. “The point of talking about the climate crisis was to show that this crisis is embedded in the practices of our lifestyle and how we address this in our life on a daily basis.” Climate change is an issue that requires holistic approaches in order to make accurate assumptions that help inform decision making and prepare for climate disasters, McBrien said. The work done in collaboration with the University’s Repair Lab has allowed students to experience this interdisciplinary approach for themselves. “It's very much seeing what you can learn in the classroom and applying it to a genuine, real world issue that actually has tangible effects on people,” Vargas said. “It’s very easy to sit back and say climate change is bad and all of that, but this really puts into perspective the amount of issues that you wouldn’t have necessarily considered otherwise, especially from an environmental justice perspective.” From the positive student reception that he has received, McBrien plans on attempting to inspire further student engagement with similar projects in the future. “My hope is that this is the beginning of something that will turn into something long term — that we can use this as an entry point into beginning to engage in these issues at a more pedagogical level at this university,” McBrien said. “Next year, I'll be teaching in the first-year engagements program, and I'm hoping to have them also be involved in doing work with the [Repair] Lab as a means not just to develop student engagement, but to actually help drive these projects.” McBrien hopes that his class will have more tangible data in mid-May, after they have concluded their historical research. He also hopes to explore the Norfolk archives with his students over the summer, where more information pertaining to the rising real estate prices in the Norfolk area is available.",Liberal
Cav Daily,"""Saving Our Planet: Starting in Our Community"" — a virtual event in recognition of Earth Day hosted by the Charlottesville National Organization for Women and the Sierra Club Piedmont Group on Thursday — showcased local efforts in Charlottesville and Albemarle County to mitigate the effects of climate change. During the event, Gabe Dayley and Susan Elliot, Albemarle County and City of Charlottesville climate protection program managers, presented current plans and goals from their jurisdictions to fight climate change. “The program’s core focuses on helping the community to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and prepare for the effects of climate change,” Elliot said. “So climate resilience and climate adaptation — what that ends up looking like is a myriad of things.” The Climate Protection Program provides services and resource programs directly to members of the community, such as the composting program. Working with community partners aids the program in communicating information to residences and businesses about retrofits to buildings, energy efficiency updates and increasing support and participation in campaigns like Solarize Charlottesville — which aims to reduce the cost and complexity of switching to solar energy. Additionally, the program looks at policy and helps other City of Charlottesville departments improve operations related to climate. In Dayley’s presentation, he introduced information about a new resource on the Albemarle County website. The Environmental Stewardship Hub — which will launch April 22 — will be a one stop webpage to learn about county programs such as biodiversity, climate action, clean water and reduce waste as well as different paths for community members to take against climate change. Elliot also provided some goals and updates for Charlottesville. Since 2011, Charlottesville has seen a 30 percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, leading to current goals of reducing emissions by 45 percent by 2030 and achieving carbon neutrality by 2050. As a member of the Global Covenant of Mayors — a global alliance for city climate leadership — Charlottesville has measured city wide greenhouse gas emissions, set a greenhouse gas reduction target, started developing a climate action plan, assessed climate vulnerabilities and started a climate adaptation plan by identifying climate hazards. In addition to Dayley and Elliots’s presentations, Office for Sustainability Director Andrea Trimble shared the University’s climate action goals and accomplishments. “Our first goal was a 25 percent reduction below 2009 levels by 2025,” Trimble said. “We achieved that six years early in 2019 through several different measures — utility scale solar, a lot of work on the district plant side and lots of work in existing buildings.” The new goals set by the University are becoming carbon neutral by 2030 and fossil fuel free by 2050. As of 2020, the University has recorded a 43.9 percent reduction in carbon emissions compared to 2010. In 2019, the University partnered with William and Mary to help each other meet carbon footprint reduction goals. This partnership has aided the University in its efforts to finalize its first climate action plan. If the University continues existing strategies like decarbonizing new and existing buildings — which consists of reducing or eliminating carbon dioxide emissions from a building’s energy reserve — and increasing renewable energy sources, 56 percent of projected emissions — the amount of purchased electricity emissions from the University in 2020 — could be eliminated. Peggy Van Yahres — Charlottesville Tree Commission Chair and the final event speaker — shared the commission’s progress and plans in increasing the tree canopy in Charlottesville. “Every four to five years we do a canopy study to see what the tree cover is in Charlottesville, whether it's growing or declining,” Van Yahres said “ We can see from 2004 to 2018 that our canopy has declined 10 percent.” Van Yahres’ presentation described multiple ways the loss of trees is affecting the local climate — including the inadequacy of the current tree planting level. The standing yearly goal is 200 trees, but that goal has not been achieved yet. In fact, Charlottesville is often losing more trees than it plants in a year. Additionally, neighborhoods with low tree canopy such as 10th and Page experience higher energy costs “Many families there pay 10 percent or more for energy, whereas the average in the city is 2.3 percent of a family’s income,” Van Yahres said. Van Yahres also described a new fund initiated by the commision, ReLeaf Cville. “Our [ReLeaf Cville] three objectives are to plant trees, preserve trees and educate,” Van Yahres said. “We’ve really done more on the education piece, particularly with kids and teenagers.” The Tree Commission is not the only organization working to involve students in combating climate change. U.Va. Sustainability works with students attending the University to educate their peers about the importance of sustainability. In an interview with The Cavalier Daily, Julianne Feuchter, a second-year College student and student employee on the outreach team for the Office of Sustainability, explained what U.Va. Sustainability is doing on the student level. Feuchter leads the Sustainability Advocates Program — which focuses on semester-long projects based on an overarching theme — with two other student employees. Outside of Feuchter’s job on the outreach team, she has been working on zero waste trainings for contracted independent organizations and Greek life. The trainings are 15 to 20 minutes presentations that give CIOs the resources they need to host their own zero waste events while also informing them of the University’s climate goals. Currently, the Office for Sustainability runs three climate oriented student leadership programs — the Sustainability Advocates, the Zero Waste Ambassadors Program and the Eco Leaders Program. Feuchter also mentioned lifestyle changes that students can make to take action against climate change, including reducing waste and the use of single use plastics, attempting to incorporate plant based eating habits and decreasing consumption of fast fashion. In an interview with The Cavalier Daily, Elliot gave similar suggestions for students. “If one day a week or two days a week students can start shifting some of their behaviors,” Elliot said. “All of that eventually does add up.” In terms of volunteering and getting involved with programs outside of the University, Van Yahres suggested volunteering with community organizations like ReLeaf Cville. “We could use volunteers for planting trees,” Van Yahres said. “We’re also going to start a teenage ambassador program in the 10th and Page neighborhood, so we could eventually use volunteers to help us with that.” While individual efforts are needed to combat climate change, the action being done on the community level is just as vital. Through the efforts addressed during Saving Our Planet by the Climate Protection Program in Albemarle County and the City of Charlottesville, the University and the Charlottesville Tree Commission, the Charlottesville area is making progress against climate change.",Liberal
Cav Daily,"Distinguished author and climate change expert Michael Mann visited the University Thursday to speak and spark discussion on his latest book, “The New Climate War: The Fight to Take Back Our Planet.” Dr. Mann addressed a lecture hall brimming with both University students and community members at an event put on by the Virginia Festival of the Book in conjunction with the Department of Environmental Sciences. Additional participants also joined via Zoom. A professor of atmospheric science at Pennsylvania State University and the director of Penn State’s Earth System Science Center, Dr. Mann has degrees in physics and applied math, as well as a Ph.D. in geology and geophysics. “The New Climate War: The Fight to Take Back Our Planet” is his fifth book. At the commencement of his hour-long presentation, Mann summed up his latest book by explaining how the challenges faced when addressing the climate crisis are largely political in nature, especially in current times. “The impacts [of climate change] are no longer subtle — we are seeing them in real-time in the form of these extreme weather events,” Mann said. Mann is of the opinion that those who contribute significantly to climate change, primarily fossil fuel corporations and their enablers, are unable to deny climate change any longer. Instead, their strategy has shifted to “deflection, division, doomism and delay.” A narrative that the degradation of the environment is at the hands of individuals — that citizens need to be more responsible with their consumption — is bogus, according to Mann. He noted that discussing the carbon footprints of individuals when a mere 100 companies are responsible for 71 percent of carbon emissions is distracting away from necessary systemic change. Due to the extensive propaganda and fear-mongering surrounding the topic, many feel a sense of helplessness, choosing to believe it is too late to save the planet. The path forward, Dr. Mann argued, requires urgency and agency. “We have to stop putting carbon pollution into the atmosphere … It’s not too late to act meaningfully,” Mann said. He urged the audience to vote out climate delayers and vote in climate advocates, not just in the presidential election, but at state and local levels as well. Mann pressed on, asking for listeners to fight against voter suppression, put pressure on Congress to act on the behalf of the people, not the polluters and to divert funding towards renewable energy sources. Mann emphasized that as the largest historical carbon polluter on the planet, the U.S. must be a leader in this fight. “We need to get countries to commit to the promises they've made,” Mann said. Mann smiled as he concluded his talk with his reasons for his optimism — the young climate activists. In recent years, figures such as Greta Thunberg, Alexandria Villaseñor and countless others have bravely led the environmental community — and the world — into the conversations necessary for a brighter future. “It’s about ethics — what sort of planet do we want to leave behind to our children and grandchildren?” Mann asked the audience. “It’s up to us, but we can't put this all on the kids … We need to take advantage of this opportunity they have given us.” The Virginia Festival of the Book hosted a variety of hybrid, in-person and virtual events in the Charlottesville and Albemarle County area from March 16 to March 20.

Cav Daily,"In response to the growing effects of climate change along Virginia’s coast, the University launched the Coastal Futures Hub in September. The hub is an initiative aimed at collaborating directly with rural populations to provide them with the necessary tools to counter climate change. Climate change is greatly affecting coastal Virginia — with rising sea levels, storm surges and soil salinity changes directly impacting the daily lives of and having long term repercussions for those in rural areas. As part of the National Science Foundation's Coastlines and People program, various professors, researchers, scientists, local community board members and the greater community will contribute to the research and application of the Coastal Futures Hub. The initiative is funded by a $5 million NSF grant and seeks to combine scientific research data with the goals and daily practices of rural coastal communities to provide agricultural and economic protection from climate change. Additionally, the hub aims for scientific research to influence and aid in the implementation of future policy pertaining to the environment within these local communities. Larry Band, co-principal investigator of the Coastal Futures Hub and environmental science professor, discussed the importance of a holistic approach to climate change in terms of coastal Virginia. “When we wrote the proposal, the idea was to see what are the threats of climate change and who is actually impacted by it,” Band said. “Very often you’ll find … communities of color may be more directly and severely impacted by environmental hazards.” Since 2006, the University’s Coastal Research Center has served as a marine field station on the Eastern Shore of Virginia and the southern end of the peninsula. The research center hosts the Virginia Coast Reserve Long Term Ecological Research program, which studies the coastline and its dynamic changes and resilience in the ecosystem. The Coastal Research Center will provide the scientific information for the Coastal Futures Hub through this program, climate layers and hydrology maps. Additionally, the research center provides a connection to the local communities on the eastern shore, which is one of the most important facets of the Coastal Futures Hub according to Cora Baird, site director of the Coastal Research Center. Baird plays an extensive role in involving community members and leaders in the discussion of how the project should be implemented. She connects community members with outside researchers in a way that facilitates discussion and bridges the gap of knowledge between the community and science. “The [community members] needed to be busted out of the broader impact section,” Baird said. “They needed to be a core consideration [in] how we do research and how we study coastlines, that we need to do the environmental and social together or we won’t make any progress.” When it comes to climate change and the environment, there is a human dimension that must be accounted for in order for research and scientific discovery to have an impact, Baird said. This is the main view that drives Baird and the Coastal Future’s Hub’s interest in involving the community from the outset. Karen McGlathery, leader of the Coastal Futures Hub and environmental science professor, explained how interdisciplinary and collaborative work provide a better method for combating climate change. “I’m really passionate about bringing people together from different points of view,” McGlathery said. “Different disciplines work together to come up with solutions to climate change impacts.” McGlathery also discussed the three legs supporting the hub project — environmental science, social science and social equity. These three attributes combine to create the Climate Equity Atlas, an interactive resource that aims to provide local communities with the accurate and precise resources they need to adapt to the rising sea levels and erosion on the eastern shore. Through the atlas, equity and science will combine directly to produce a tool for the community to use as its members continue their daily lives within a changing environment. Because the atlas concerns the living conditions of the community, it is important to have the community involved in the making of the atlas, McGlathery explained. “The real asset behind this program is that by having the community at the table navigating our decision-making and really taking control over this atlas from the beginning, it gives us the chance to see the social and environmental layers on top of each other,” Baird said. The initiative starts with asking community members questions about where they feel the impact of climate change and what they need help with in terms of environmental inequity. From here, the researchers and data scientists will gauge which resources and knowledge can best address the community’s issues. The five-year-long project will end with the creation of the atlas as a decision support tool, which the community can take over in order to better inform their daily lives. Additionally, the tool will help to direct local legislation and decision-making pertaining to agriculture, the environment and pollution. Currently, the project is in its early stages — which mainly consists of discussing and meeting with community members to establish an agenda. As one of the first of its kind, the Coastal Futures Hub demonstrates a bridge between local communities and science that could play a role in influencing other projects in the future.",Liberal
Cav Daily,"In the final year of the decade, Oxford Dictionary has announced the word of the year — climate emergency. According to NASA, the world has seen a global rise in temperature, sinking ice sheets, sea level rise and extreme weather events. As people become more aware of the effects of climate change, Willis Jenkins, the convener of Environmental Humanities at the University and co-director of Coastal Futures Conservatory, anticipates an increased urgency in the climate crisis conversation over the next decade. “No longer focused on future scenarios, climate conversations are connecting the rapid impacts unfolding now across multiple systems with a sense that we are watching a disaster unfold around us,” Jenkins said. “It is clearer now that the delayed response of the past 30 years have been costly.” Local reactions to the climate change topic were seen at the beginning of the 2019 fall semester, as hundreds of U.Va. students and community members marched from the Rotunda to the Downtown Mall in order to bring awareness to the issue. In addition, the University has recently announced a goal, alongside William & Mary, to be carbon neutral by 2030 and fossil fuel-free by 2050. Looking towards the next 10 years, Deborah Lawrence, professor in the Department of Environmental Sciences and leader of the environmental practice program at the University, stresses the importance of a positive and attainable path forward. This path includes three parts — electrifying everything, greening the grid and securing a safety net. The first and second parts of this plan, electrifying everything and greening the grid, go hand-in-hand. A future of electric means replacing wired single-power plants with solar and wind farms. “Greening the grid requires a lot of work to improve what the power sources are that feed our electric grid,” Lawrence said. “There's a huge amount of work that needs to be done on understanding and thinking about how the new grid will work, how a system of distributed power sources works.” The final piece of this vision, securing a safety net, requires the use of negative emissions technologies, or NET. Lawrence says that if we want to stay below two degrees Celsius of warming, carbon dioxide output cannot just be stopped, but it needs to be taken out of the atmosphere. According to Lawrence, humanity’s carbon dioxide emissions need to peak by 2030 then rapidly decline. After zero emissions is achieved, we must then go below zero. As of now, forests are taking up carbon dioxide via photosynthesis, though new technologies are being created to eat up additional carbon. One of those technologies is Bio-Energy with Carbon Capture and Storage, where plants are grown and burned to create a concentrated stream of CO2, which is then collected and stored underground for thousands of years. The second, which Lawrence claims is much farther out from being used, is Direct Air Capture. In DAC, air is sucked into a machine, which sorts CO2 from all other air molecules. Collected CO2 is then made into cement, or another liquified, pressurized stream and buried. “It doesn't exist yet,” Lawrence said. “The challenge with Direct Air Capture is that CO2 is 410 parts per million, so 410 things you're trying to get out of a million molecules. It's a bad math problem.” Though parts of the country have been dramatically affected by climate change, whether that be via hurricanes, fires or drought, areas such as Charlottesville have seen much less of an effect. In the past year, the area has seen record hot August and October months, as well as an unusual tornado warning on Halloween. Third-year College student Jasmyn Noel is a part of the University’s Sustainability department’s Energy and Water Committee and anticipates that more people will become involved in the climate change topic as greater effects are experienced. “I believe that when climate change causes a bigger disturbance to people's daily lives, the topic will finally be discussed and taken seriously among the metaphorical ‘bigger tables,’ where our politicians sit,” Noel said. In order to combat the current environmental changes, Jenkins believes that the most important thing for people to do is pay attention. “Climate change is already a challenge to human minds because of the scales of time and space involved, and the indirect lines of causation and impact,” Jenkins said. “Add to that investments by climate denialists in confusion and conflict, and the resulting sense of political paralysis, and we all have a strong incentive to look away.” When it comes to action among her generation, Noel encourages young adults to not only reduce their carbon footprint but also stresses the importance of political action. “Talk with others about climate change and its effects, let your political leaders hear you and vote for those who listen,” Noel said. “Even better, become the leaders in your field of interest, where you have the power to make change for our communities."" With constant headlines of natural disasters and melting ice sheets, Jenkins claims that the greatest challenge over the next decade will be to avoid naturalizing the changes unfolding around us. “If we accommodate ourselves to such weirdness — as if big fire seasons, disappearing species, melting glaciers, bleaching coral, submerging coasts were unchangeable processes of the planet — then we won’t see the impacts as political, as matters of responsibility,” Jenkins said. As we look toward the next decade, Lawrence says it is important to look back at the passing decade to see all of the change that has been made to improve the climate and make people aware. “Countries are taking this seriously, and the renewable energy revolution is happening,” Lawrence said. “This is the decade … I urge all of you to think about what you're going to do for this decade, and how you're going to make a better climate future for all of us.”",Liberal
Cav Daily,"With global temperatures on the rise and the effects of climate change already taking hold in many different parts of the world, there seems to be an urgent responsibility across generations to take action against the continuation of these issues. This is a difficult reality to grasp, however, and the complications and ethical questions of how to live in a sustainable way is often hard to reconcile with the accustomed standard of living. “‘Lungs,” the most recent production from the University’s Drama Department, attempts to tackle these questions and more through the lens of a young couple trying to decide whether or not they are ready — or if it is even morally responsible — to have a child. The show, which was performed on an entirely bare stage by a cast of two, moves across time and space as they attempt to work through the anxieties of being young and unsure, while simultaneously bearing witness to the gradual collapse of the earth as they know it. Climate change is the unseen third character alongside the cast of two, although the play is about much more than just that particular issue. There are questions of love and loss, and a feeling of grief for themselves, for each other, and for the world, which permeates every bit of dialogue and segment of blocking. The Friday production itself was modest in its presentation — as specified by the playwright, the show takes place with no indication of place or time other than the context of the dialogue. There was no miming, no costume changes, no set or sound effects. This understated structure was incredibly effective in the compelling nature of the piece — it shifted all of the focus from the external environment to the internal aspect of the dialogue and physicality from the actors. This especially highlighted the depth of the text — its complexities and staggering relatability. The piece, which is both fast paced and urgent as well as thoughtful and quiet, flows with almost stammering truthfulness. The dialogue feels theatrical, certainly, but also touches upon some shared understanding of fear and uncertainty. The cast, though small, brings this nuanced, dynamic piece to life with care and enthusiasm, playing with many different levels of emotion and drawing in the small, closely seated audience with delicate captivation. The vision of director Dave Dalton, an assistant professor in the Department of Drama, catalyzed this effect, as he worked with student assistant directors Jakob Cansler, a third-year in the College, and Savannah Maive, a fourth-year in the College, to produce the show. ‘Lungs’ notably features three different casts, each of which performs on different nights of the run. For Dalton, the show’s unique technical constraints were part of its appeal. “I was interested in the challenges of a two person show without costume changes or sets,” Dalton said. The unique nature of this piece certainly created challenges for the production team, as each of the three casts received less overall time with the primary director. The solution to this came in the form of the assistant directors, who worked with each cast to elaborate and solidify Dalton’s vision when he was not directly working with them. This system of division and collaboration helped each cast to think creatively about their own interpretation of the text, as well as emphasizing the complexity of the piece in the fact that each cast could bring their own ideas and character angles to the table without compromising the underlying meaning of the play. Third-year College student Charles Hurt and Madeline Walker, a fourth-year in the College — one of the three casts — gave compelling performances in their opening night Friday, particularly in their very realistic portrayal of the couple. Walker’s impressive expressive range and intensity was well-balanced with Hurt’s more relaxed ease and rhythm — both of which formed a nuanced and intimate chemistry that never broke throughout the 80-minute runtime. The strength of these actors built the foundation for the entire show. When added to the subtle but beautiful use of lights placed along the far wall to only vaguely indicate time, it culminated in an innovative performance which spoke to the value and flexibility of the theater and brought forward a unique artistic standpoint to the issue of climate change. Lungs will be performed in the Helms Theatre through Oct. 12.",Liberal
Cav Daily,"Over a hundred students, faculty and community members gathered near the Rotunda Friday to join the Global Climate Strike movement, in which people worldwide striked to demand that the United Nations take serious action to mitigate climate change during its Climate Action Summit Sept. 23. At noon, the participants walked to the Downtown Mall to join the hundreds who attended the concurrent Charlottesville Youth Climate Strike, organized by local seventh grader Gudrun Campbell. The Virginia Student Environmental Coalition hosted the strike on Grounds and invited various climate and social activists within Charlottesville to speak to the crowd. Joyce Cheng, fourth-year College student and organizer of the University strike, also read aloud a list of demands directed towards the United States, the Commonwealth and the University. The goal of the strike was to shed light on those most affected by climate change, demand a divestment from fossil fuels and call for the University to commit to a 100 percent carbon neutrality plan, echoing the petition published by Wahoos for Sustainability. The event cost around $400, paying for paint and materials for signs as well as a megaphone. In between VSEC-led chants, the series of speakers all voiced the need for the youth to take charge of the fight against climate change, the importance of voting for politicians who will advocate for the environment and the fact that that underprivileged populations bear the brunt of climate disaster. According to Cheng, VSEC wanted to invite speakers that would represent the perspective of communities often unheard in the global environmental discussion. “Climate change is going to affect every single community in the world,” Cheng said. “We want to make sure … we have representation from [communities] who are going to be most affected in the future.” Karishma Srikanth, Charlottesville Alliance for Refugees president and third-year College student, shared at the rally that those who least contribute to carbon emissions are affected by climate change the most and called for the international protection of climate refugees. “Climate refugees by and large come from communities of color,” Srikanth said. Caroline Campos, second-year College student and PLUMAS member, also explained to the crowd that the climate movement needs to collaborate with social justice movements and an improved immigration system. “Fight for today and those who have been historically marginalized,” Campos said. “I call you to listen … and listen very closely.” Anthony Malabad, fourth-year College student and the president of the Native American Student Union, was also a speaker at the University strike and told the crowd that the people who currently hold political power are not making decisions for the benefit of the planet. Erik Patton-Sharpe, fourth-year College student and U.Va. Students United member, agreed with Malabad’s statement and added that young people cannot wait for government officials to respond to climate change but rather need to be the ones to create change. Alexis Zeigler, owner and designer of the Living Energy Farm — a farm that is completely dependent on renewable energy — along with Environmental Economics Prof. William Shobe spoke at the strike about the need for collective restructuring of institutions and infrastructure that is based on energy from cheap fossil fuels. Shobe and Zeigler told the crowd that a prioritizing renewable energy is actually quite possible and economically viable. Shobe and Phoebe Crisman, director of the environments and sustainability track of the global studies major, also called on young people to take the lead on mitigating the climate crisis. “Despair is not called for,” Shobe said. “We know many affordable pathways to solutions.… [Young people] are the ones who will put the nail in the coffin of the climate disaster.” The strike at the Rotunda also featured Richard Walker as a speaker, a resident of Union Hill and founder of Bridging the Gap in Virginia — a non-profit organization dedicated to assisting people struggling to find employment and to addressing climate justice. Walker advocated for the divestment from Dominion Energy and pipeline-supporting businesses, and he recounted how his house is in the direct pathway of the currently developing Atlantic Coast Pipeline. “[It is] time for us to stand and continue to stand,” Walker said. According to Campbell, pipelines were also a main point for the Charlottesville Youth Climate Strike. Through Friday’s strike, Campbell and her mother, Elizabeth Stark, wanted to bring attention to Dominion’s planned and current pipelines that run through Virginia. “We've invited people that are on the ground doing this work to try to bring this story to Charlottesville and help people understand that this pipeline is devastating,” Stark said. Recently, Campbell traveled to a town hall meeting in Union Hill to learn more about how a compressor station might damage the wildlife and human health in that area. “[The residents] love Virginia because of its clean air, and you can go outside, and you can roll the windows down when you're driving places,” Campbell said. “The compressor station would take all that away from them.” The Youth Climate Strike Friday was the third climate strike seventh grader Campbell has organized this year. She is inspired by other young activists, like Nobel Peace Prize-nominee Greta Thunberg and New York City activist Alexandria Villaseñor. Campbell said in an interview with The Cavalier Daily that she is encouraged by the support she receives from the Charlottesville community and hopes to make her future strikes more accessible to young people by contacting schools and organizing transportation to and from strikes. Sarah Bryan, fourth-year College student and financial coordinator for the on-Grounds Climate Strike, explained in an interview that VSEC has also been involved in trying to block the Atlantic Coast and Mountain Valley pipelines from being built and in encouraging the University to divest from fossil fuels, although the University “has not been very responsive.” Cheng agrees. She believes that U.Va. Sustainability is indeed making the University more eco-friendly — especially with the recent announcement that the University is six years ahead of its carbon reduction schedule — but also thinks that it could do more if the University allocated more resources to the office and if the Board of Visitors were more dedicated to the issue of reducing the University’s carbon footprint. “I believe that the Board of Visitors is … the organization or group of people who’s preventing U.Va. from taking greater strides in sustainability,“ Cheng said. Cheng and Bryan hope the strike not only pushes the University to meet VSEC’s list of demands, but also shows how students are committed to the idea of sustainability. Although the organization is not planning another rally this semester, it will continue to educate its members and the community on local environmental issues and demand University divestment from fossil fuels. “I think U.Va. has a responsibility to do more in terms of climate change and sustainability,” Cheng said. “Hopefully the administration sees how much we care and takes stronger action.”",Liberal
Cav Daily,"Hidden within delicate blue petals and a green slender stalk, the American bellflower offers more than just aesthetic value. Biologists at the University of Virginia and Washington State University published a joint study Aug. 29 focusing on the effects of historic climate change and range expansion on the development of the American bellflower — Campanula americana. With climate change occurring on a wide scale, researchers used the American bellflower as a model to provide insight on plant and animal reactions to historic and current climate change and to predict responses to future climate change. “With contemporary climate change, there have been lots of predictions about how organisms will respond to those changes,” said Matthew Koski, a former postdoctoral researcher at the University, an author of the study and now an assistant professor of biology at Clemson University. “They could adapt to their conditions, they could migrate or they could unfortunately go extinct. We are using historical climate change to think about how populations would respond today.” The American bellflower is a common flower in the United States, spanning the entire length of the country from the Great Lakes to the Gulf Coast and from the East Coast to the Midwest. Despite its name, the bellflower’s flat petals extend outward and curl slightly at the edges. Laura Galloway, Commonwealth Professor of Biology and one of the authors of the article, has studied the American bellflower for some time. “I’ve worked on the American bellflower for many years, and it’s one of these things as I keep working on it, I uncover the answers to some questions, and then new questions pop up,” Galloway said. “It’s a wonderful plant to work with in that respect. It’s always giving me questions to work on.” Her latest research is the result of one of these questions. Several years ago, while observing samples from diverse American bellflower populations in a greenhouse at the University, Galloway observed that some plants produced fruit without the aid of pollinators. Wondering why, Galloway’s lab explored this discrepancy and noticed a pattern — in the northern limits of the bellflower’s range, self-pollination was a common method of reproduction. A hypothesis sprouted from this analysis — perhaps the pattern stemmed from the American bellflower’s past. The species experienced significant changes in its environment approximately 15,000 years ago. At this time, glaciers covered much of North America, confining multiple species of plants and animals to restricted havens that supported life. However, as the glaciers melted and began to retreat, these species, including American bellflowers, traveled northward. “I was trying to figure out why would it be that plants in the northwestern part of the distribution [self-pollinate] and the plants in the southeastern part don’t,” Galloway said. “I started to think that maybe it had to do with the increase in its geographic range after the last glaciation.” In order to pinpoint the initial habitat of the flowers during this time period, Galloway joined with researchers from Washington State University, who sampled individuals from 24 populations within the bellflower’s range and sequenced their genomes. According to characteristic mutations in different populations, they determined that the plants congregated in what is known as a glacial refugium in the Appalachian Mountains in present-day eastern Kentucky. Not only that, but the progression of genetic mutations served as a reflection of the American bellflower’s geographic dissemination. Distinct genetic patterns indicated small populations migrated from the refugium and spread to the exposed terrain the melting glaciers left in their wake. As these small populations capitalized on available land, they faced different selective pressures or environmental conditions that favored certain traits. Galloway and Koski investigated these adaptations in the same 24 bellflower populations in their greenhouse at the University. Ultimately, they confirmed Galloway’s previous discovery that populations further from the historic epicenter of the bellflower had an increased tendency to self — individuals were more likely to undergo self-fertilization in order to produce offspring rather than rely on pollinators. However, bellflower communities at the leading edge of its geographic range did not simply gain advantages that promoted survival and reproduction. When a subset of a larger population establishes a new settlement, the amount of genetic diversity in this nascent population is invariably reduced. As a result, the relatively homogenous population has a lower chance of survival in the case of extreme changes in climate — they no longer have the luxury of a large gene pool that could potentially provide beneficial mutations in the case of habitat disruption. “Our work tells us a lot about evolution in natural populations as they spread across the landscape and as they migrate in response to climate change,” Koski said. “We looked at the impact of historic climate change, but populations are continually spreading northward and upward in elevation due to contemporary climate change, which has a major impact on how populations reproduce.” Findings from the study indicate that there are trade-offs to subsisting at the extremes of a species’ range. For northern offshoots of the original American bellflower habitat, self-pollination confers a selective advantage. On the other hand, these individuals also experience diminished fitness in the face of deleterious genetic mutations. Yet, the story does not end here. With climate change once again occurring on a wide scale, questions linger about whether or not plant and animal species will adapt at the rate necessary to survive. “Historic climate change was more gradual than contemporary climate change, so it’s a good model for what could happen, but we do not really know if populations are going to be able to migrate as quickly as they need to under contemporary climate change,” Koski said. In order to better understand how the American bellflower sustained itself during the last ice age, and if it has the capacity to weather a new wave of climate change, additional research must be done, Galloway and Koski said. For example, it has not been definitively established whether American bellflower self-pollination is the cause or effect of dispersal, a fact that may aid in predicting responses to shifting environmental conditions in other organisms. “We can look at how plants and animals responded to the last climate change and use that to frame our expectations and our response to ongoing climate change,” Galloway said. “That’s really important because it says we have information we can use to make good predictions to test.”",Liberal
Cav Daily,"For the second year in a row, Environmental Sciences Prof. Deborah Lawrence aimed to intersect the arts and sciences to inform the public about the changing planet. Through her course EVSC 1559, “Write Climate, Right Climate,” Lawrence helped students use literary, artistic and activist means to create a display in the Mural Room of Clark Hall to raise awareness for climate change. This semester is the first time the course has partnered with a local artist to create the culminating display. “The goal is to try and use art to create some awareness around climate change, a commitment to do something about it and a sense of community,” Lawrence said. “You don’t want to do anything if you’re not feeling connected and if you don’t feel like it’s your job, so we try to take that message out and around Grounds.” Lawrence’s course convenes in the spring semester, and for the past three weeks, her students tabled around grounds to collect the voices of 1200 of their peers on little pieces of paper. “We’ve asked community members at U.Va. to write down … something about how they feel about climate change, what they’re doing about it, do they have questions, you know, their concerns,” said Amanda Nelson, the artist helping Prof. Lawrence and the class on this project. “It’s either a scientific statement, a policy statement or individual statement about climate change.” Hannah Hervey, first-year College student in EVSC 1559, said that she appreciated getting to know what the University as a whole thinks about climate change. After reading these individual slips of paper, she felt that she was helping connect the community around this topic. “I'm taking the individual thoughts and ideas from people that play some role in the UVa community and literally combining them all together to make a bigger statement about the environment,” Hervey said in an email statement sent to The Cavalier Daily. “[It] is not only a beautiful concept in itself but also symbolic of how we need to come together as a community on this issue if we want to make a significant change.” The class changed its approach to addressing climate change this year by expanding its footprint with a two-step reveal as opposed to last year’s single Clark Hall display. Specifically, students worked alongside Nelson to artistically compile the University community’s notes into a preliminary “teaser” and plan to showcase their major installation at a surprise location on-Grounds on Earth Day, April 22. The preliminary piece — found in the Clark Hall Mural Room — consists of four panels covered with policy statements and scientific investigations all relating to climate change. The community notes were incorporated into the panels by shaping them into numbers that read the year “2030.” Nelson explained that this layout was significant to attracting the audience’s attention and inspiring them to think about their actions. She described the questions that inspired this layout. “Is it next year that means it’s urgent, is it in the next 11 years, is it now?” Nelson said. “Is it a number, is it a phrase? What invites curiosity, but also empowers action?” The display’s layout also complements the project’s goal of using impactful art to connect with community members but also to serve as a call to action for the urgency of climate change. “We’ve tried to look at different websites and different texts — and how you present truth, you know, in science … without scaring people away,” Nelson said. “To try and invite conversation by trying to not be overly didactic but also not be binary. It’s not you are with us or you’re against us, it’s just let’s have a conversation because this is really important to me, and I feel it’s very urgent.” Another way this project expanded from last year was with the formation of the Write Climate Club. Brian Hnat — a third-year College student and president of Write Climate who took EVSC 1559 last spring — talked about how it was difficult to maintain momentum of the productive class within the confines of a classroom. “We realized that we needed a club to do the things that the class couldn’t do, which included being a little more politically active,” Hnat said. The club published a website, maintains a social media presence, has led meetings to write to members of Congress advocating their support for the Green New Deal and plans to write on Beta Bridge soon. While the club has a sizeable cohort, Hnat said that that it is always welcoming passionate, new members. In the future, Lawrence hopes to expand the model of Write Climate and her course to other schools and campuses. Lawrence aims to first reach local high schools next year to teach them how to create similar projects or even start their own club chapters. Regardless of her target audience, she wants everyone to be mindful of how their actions contribute to the changing planet. “Ultimately, we want to write climate for the right climate,” Lawrence said. “It’s something we wanted people to do and think about everyday.” As a scientist working with an artist and University students, Lawrence hopes the project’s emphasis on interdisciplinary collaboration persists through the years. “Science can only tell us so much about where we need to go, and ultimately, the conversation on climate change has to be bigger than just the science,” Lawrence said. “We have to engage people in a way that gets them thinking and gets them reflecting on what they value.”",Liberal
Cav Daily,"While deadly wildfires rage in California and Hurricane Maria’s true death toll remains unknown, Central Virginia may seem far removed from the devastating impacts of climate change. Although the state has generally been insulated from highly publicized extreme weather events, small climatic shifts are creating significant problems for Virginia’s large agriculture industry. Vineyards, close to the hearts of many in Charlottesville, have been feeling the effects of climate change quite acutely this year. “Anybody that grows anything is concerned about climate change, in a way that people that might be further removed from agriculture aren't,” said Matthew Brown, the wine club manager for King Family Vineyards and a University alumnus. Because crop success depends so heavily on on the weather, growers are paying particularly close attention to even the slightest changes and developing techniques to cope. According to Deborah Lawrence — an environmental science professor who specializes in climate change — average temperatures in Virginia are increasing. Warmer weather leads to more pests, more disease and more ripening, which is particularly relevant for vineyards. Ripening produces the sugar within grapes, which goes on to produce the alcohol found in wine. More ripening means more sugar and more alcohol in the final product. One innovative way to help slow the ripening process is by using a product called Surround, a white sprayable clay that farmers can apply to their crops to help reflect UV light, keeping them cooler and preventing precocious ripening. However, that is not the only benefit the spray offers. Derived from a natural mineral, the clay is extremely sharp on a microscopic level. While it is harmless to humans, it effectively repels many of the bugs and pests that become more prolific in a warmer climate. While temperatures are trending upwards, short-term concerns for Virginia's agriculture have more to do with colder springs and heavy rain. One result of climate change unique to the Southeast are polar vortices — created by changing conditions at the poles affecting the jet stream — that blast cold air into the region during the winter and spring. The spring months, when the grapes have just started to bud, are when the plants are at their most sensitive. One harsh frost could mean the loss of the entire year’s crop. King Family Vineyards has taken several steps to try to prevent this. During cold spring nights, warmer air rises creating what’s known as the inversion layer. The winery has installed a wind machine, and will sometimes even fly helicopters over the vineyard, in order to force this warmer air down among the vines. On particularly cold nights, they resort to burning bales of hay near the plants. The major challenge facing viticulturists right now though is the rain. 2018 has been the wettest year on record to-date for Washington, D.C. and Roanoke, and the second wettest year for Richmond. All of that water is creating serious consequences for crop producers. Lawrence said that heavy spring flooding can wipe out immature sprouts, and more moisture means increased chances of mold and mildew. To reduce foliage, vineyards have to “manage the canopy,” which means hand-trimming leaves to make sure the plants have enough surface area for photosynthesis, but not so much to make them prone to fungal growth. When the vines absorb more water, they also give more water to the grapes, which can dilute their flavor. In order to maintain high quality standards, King Family has had to concentrate their wines. While this preserves the desired flavor, color, aroma and tannin, up to 20 percent of the liquid initially produced is lost in the process. The financial impact of increased precipitation goes well beyond simply lost product though. Intensive canopy management necessitates increased labor costs, and rainy weekends have hurt agritourism in Virginia wine country. To help allay the problems created by changing weather patterns, Glass House Winery, in Free Union, Va., has opted to focus on different varieties of wine that are less affected by the rain. “My too-often-repeated 2018 joke,” Glass House Winery owner Jeff Sanders said. ""When life gives you lemons, make lemonade. When it gives you this year's weather, make rosé."" Sanders said we “are not prescient enough” so know how exactly how climate change will impact wineries the the future. However, Brown described what can be expected from wine in different climates. Warmer weather will mean wines that have higher alcohol and sugar levels, depleting their structure and making them taste “jammy,” while places experiencing cooler conditions will produce higher acid wines, similar to champagne. For Lawrence, the key is creativity. “The innovators who discover which grapes are both tolerant of our extreme weather and delicious will be the ones that do well,” Lawrence said. “I would urge innovation and experimentation.” Brown, who frequently interacts with winemakers from the around the world due to his studies at the Institute of Master of Wine based out of London, noted that climate change is playing an increasing role in discussions about wine. However, he feels that the United States is not on the same page. “It does seem like we live in the only country in the world where it's an option to believe in climate change,” Brown said. “Which is just terribly tragic.”",Liberal
Cav Daily,"The group “Write Climate” has sponsored a climate change awareness exhibit displayed during Earth Week in Clark Hall. Write Climate is a group of University students who meet to advocate for the fundamentals of climate-related science and policy awareness through art. The exhibit was displayed in Clark Hall April 17 to April 23 and was previously displayed at the Amphitheater. The components of the exhibit were paper-based and ranged from a board of sticky-notes inscribed with responses to why students and community members fought for climate change to a tsunami art piece composed of crumpled pieces of paper. On its website, Write Climate describes itself an interdisciplinary group of students from a variety of schools on Grounds, including the College, Engineering school and Architecture school. Environmental Sciences Prof. Deborah Lawrence organized EVSC 1559: Words on Paper: History of Climate Science, Policy and Art, the weekly class in which Write Climate meets. Lawrence said the students’ process for creating the art began with reviewing texts in climate science and policy, including pieces as far back as 1824. After reviewing climate policy and science texts, the students tabled on Grounds, asking passersby to write on paper what worries them about climate change, what they do in terms of sustainability or about a certain concept of climate change and policy. In total, the class received responses from about 1,200 people. The paper responses were then turned into art at the discretion of the students in the class. “This is a different way of communicating about climate change,” Lawrence said about the exhibit. “We are trying to grab people's attention in a new way … with a connection based on our shared climate story at the very heart of it all.” Second-year College student Maame Eghan participated in the exhibit as part of the requirements for the class taught by Lawrence. She and a partner produced a 3D Earth by manipulating paper slips containing the written pieces gained from tabling sessions. Eghan said she believed the exhibit was important because it created awareness to both the current beauty of the Earth and what a future affected by climate change might look like. Sade Storthz is a first-year College student who also participated in the exhibit through EVSC 1559. She is on the documentary crew of the class but also worked with a partner to create a sculpture. She agreed with Eghan’s sentiment that the significance of the exhibit was in communicating the realities of climate change. By asking students and faculty both why they care about and how they will act on climate change, she said she hopes that those same individuals will incorporate incremental lifestyle changes. She said that she liked the involved nature of the exhibit and how it engaged others outside the class, noting that simply seeing the amount of people involved in creating the art and responses was empowering. “The artists weren’t limited to our class,” Storthz said. “Everyone who stopped by our tables and wrote something is helping to raise climate change awareness and played a role in creating the art.” Lawrence stated that the goal of creating awareness about climate change was achieved. “Perhaps the best thing about it was that we were able to reach out to people who really never think about climate change,” Lawrence said. “We all need to think about climate change.”",Liberal
Cav Daily,"The University Office for Sustainability and University Dining hosted a climate solutions expo Tuesday in which students, faculty and community members gathered in the Newcomb Hall ballroom to share and present ideas to combat the effects of climate change and increase sustainability. The expo was part of University Sustainability annual Earth Week celebration, which kicked off Monday, and includes a variety of lectures, panels, workshops and other events that promote and teach sustainable living practices at the University and in the local community. The Earth Week expo is the largest of the more than 25 events hosted by the student-run group this week and introduced climate solutions based on Project Drawdown’s top 100 solutions for reversing climate change. Project Drawdown is a non-profit global coalition of scholars, entrepreneurs and advocates who seek to map, measure, model and communicate how existing technology can be utilized to “draw down” carbon emissions in our atmosphere. The 100 solutions proposed range from reducing food waste, consuming a plant-rich diet, educating girls, expanding renewable energy sources and many more. In planning this event, University sustainability reached out to 45 University and community organizations that work on addressing these 100 solutions in real world initiatives. Some of these organizations included Campus Kitchens, Veggies of Virginia and the Young Women’s Leadership Program and the Delta Force Program. Liam Kiniry, a fourth-year Architecture School student and member of University Sustainability, said that the expo allowed the organization to display some of the sustainability efforts taking place on Grounds and in the local community in one place. “[It] showcases all the efforts towards sustainability that have been found on Grounds and among all our different partners for sustainability — in and outside the University,” Kiniry said. “It’s like our public face.” Many of the initiatives proposed at the expo involved food sustainability and security in the local Charlottesville community. Representatives from Campus Kitchens, a national nonprofit, were also in attendance at the event. The University chapter of Campus Kitchens works in close partnership with U.Va. Dining, as well as local restaurants and grocery stores, to collect unused food and donate it to people around the area in need. The organization donates over 50 individual meals every week to community members in need, which are delivered to local nonprofits such as the Ronald McDonald House, the Haven, Hope House and Love INC. Harry Laird, a representative for Campus Kitchens, said that the University has successfully taken steps to reduce food waste and increase sustainability efforts on Grounds. “[The University] has a really strong initiative to cut back on [food waste],” Laird said. “They’ve done the best they can to put out as many metrics as possible to make sure that there's not a lot of food waste.” The University CIO Veggies of Virginia also made an appearance at the expo to encourage people to sign up for their annual plant-based pledge. The plant-based pledge is a week long pledge by students to reduce or completely remove animal products from their plate. Signed-up students receive information each day during the week with guidance for eating vegetarian or vegan diets. Participants are also entered into a raffle to win gift cards for places on the Corner. According to statistics produced by the organization, in 2017, 83 people signed up for the week-long pledge, saving upwards of 639,100 gallons of water, 17,430 square feet of forested land, 26.145 pounds of grain and reducing greenhouse gas emissions by an equivalent of 1,660 pounds of carbon dioxide as a group. This year, over 150 people have signed this pledge, which could nearly double these statistics. Pooj Seth, a fourth-year global environment and sustainability and economics major, was at the event presenting her capstone project, which proposed an economic solution to food sustainability. Seth has developed a pay-it-forward program with local restaurants — such as Revolutionary Soup and Take It Away on the Corner — which allows customers to pay for an extra meal that will be donated to someone unable to purchase a meal themselves. “[The program] creates a more dignified manner of consumption in Charlottesville because people don't have to ask for handouts, and they can create more ownership over their food,” Seth said. “[It allows for] people of different socioeconomic statuses to exist together in the same space … giving an equity level to sustainability.” Seth added that this equity also allows money to stay in the community and provides resource sharing so that all socioeconomic statuses have access to high quality foods. Non-food-related groups were also in attendance, including the Young Women Leaders Program and the Delta Force Program. The Young Women Leaders Program is run by the University’s Maxine Platzer Women’s Center and the Curry School of education and strives to empower and educate young women both in the Charlottesville area and globally. Kelly Hill, a third-year College student involved with the Young Women Leaders Program, said that empowering women is also an initiative that contributes to sustainability. “When women are educated or empowered ... they contribute more than their male counterparts,” Hill said. “They put more of their money and time back into the environment, and that increases sustainability. When you empower women and they are able to put their resources back into their own farms, they are able to produce more food for their community.” Jesse Warren, University Sustainability Program Manager, represented the Delta Force Program, which is a University initiative to retrofit University with more energy efficient technology, such as insulation, LED lighting and solar panels. Warren said the program has had incredible success so far. Warren cited Clark Hall as an example in which $1.6 million has been invested into energy efficient technology and has reduced annual energy costs in the building from $1.2 million to roughly $600,000, according to Warren. “We have a carbon goal that we are supposed to hit by 2025, [and] in order to do this we’ve got to make reductions to the top energy users on Grounds,” Warren said. “In reality, we haven’t been able to get to all of them…[but] we are still meeting our goals because we are seeing bigger than planned reductions in the buildings we have [already] retrofitted.” Kiniry said while the University has successfully set forth many sustainability and conservation efforts, he added that the full support of the student body is necessary to enact institutional change. “The University is pretty on board, [but] it’s pretty hard in an institution, from a student position, to make large scale institutional changes,” Kiniry said. “So that's part of the reason why direct student outreach is so important.”",Liberal
Cav Daily,"Students in the course “Words on Paper: History of Climate Science, Policy and Art,” EVSC 1559, have been working all semester on an installation to raise awareness about climate change. The Write Climate exhibit was on display in the Mural Room of Clark Hall March 22-27. This is the pilot semester of the course, which is taught by Environmental Science Prof. Deborah Lawrence. Lawrence said that the class consists of learning about climate science history, climate policy history and art and community engagement. “We started out trying to understand the history of climate science,” Lawrence said. “We looked for the major turning points starting in 1824 when we first hypothesized about the greenhouse effect.” According to Lawrence, after learning about the history of climate science, they studied the history of climate policy. “We looked for the policy story, which is the other part, and that starts in the United States in 1955 with the first law on air pollution. . . and then we trace the arc of that climate policy story in our country,” Lawrence said. “Once we had these milestones, when we were looking at the texts, we were trying to say ‘what are the words that grab you?’” Then, the students in EVSC 1559 started setting up tables at various locations on Grounds before Spring Break to raise awareness on climate change and engage a larger audience, according to second-year Engineering student Anna Cerf, who is in Lawrence’s class. Lawrence said they tabled for three to four weeks, asking people to participate in writing about the climate story. They had various choices of prompts which people could respond to. Participants could write about a myriad of subjects, including a fact about the history of climate science history, the policy history, why they care about climate change or how they are mitigating their effect on climate change. “I think the most interesting responses we got were what actions someone takes or what actions someone recommends taking to help address the issue,” said Samuel Mogen, a second-year College student in Lawrence’s class. Similarly, Lawrence said that having people writing about climate change, rather than just talking about it, is very powerful. “When you write something, your brain acts differently, and your brain responds differently and your heart responds differently,” Lawrence said. “You actually commit. We wanted to get people to commit with us.” The class displayed these responses written on pieces of paper on bulletin boards in the Mural Room in Clark Hall. There was also a station in the installation where people could add to the collage. Lawrence said that by showcasing the pieces of paper, the class aimed to move people by the number of responses and to raise awareness about climate change. “We’re hoping to have a conversation about it to heighten awareness of the fact that we have known about climate change for a long time — 200 years,” Lawrence said. “We’ve not only done good science for a long time, we’ve also done good policy for a long time and it’s been across the board, it’s been bi-partisan, just part of who the United States of America is.” Environmental Sciences Prof. Scott Doney said the exhibit was a good way of engaging people in an optimistic way and breaking down the polarizing debate that often surrounds discussions about climate change. “It could give people a sense that they did actually have a voice and a possibility that they can lead to a better outcome,” Doney said. In addition to fostering conversations about the history and importance of this issue, the display prompted students to write about what they can do to mitigate climate change. Second-year College student Carly Starobin visited the display and said that allowing students to write about what they’ve done to reduce their personal effect on the climate provides ideas for other students who read it as well. According to Lawrence, this was only the first step in the project— she has plans to expand it further. Next, the class is going to take these pieces of paper from the installation in Clark and create art as a group project. For example, Cerf and second-year College student Jamie Wertz are in the same group in the class. Wertz said the group will use blue papers from the display to create an image of flooding due to rising sea levels against a city skyline. “We’re going to show the potential impacts of climate change if action isn’t taken,” Cerf said. In addition to the art projects, Lawrence said the class will participate in the Earth Week Expo: 100 Climate Solutions, which will be held in the Newcomb Ballroom April 17. She also plans to take the project off Grounds and work with high schools in the Charlottesville area to further share the climate story. “So far, we’ve touched 1,000 people, and we hope to go even further,” Lawrence said.",Liberal
National Review,"To the man with a hammer, everything looks like a nail. To the national director of the Green New Deal Network — a cliché of an activist group devoted to popularizing a variety of progressive social-justice and climatological causes through quasi-revolutionary cosplay — everything looks like “climate change and colonialism.” Those are the two culprits behind Maui’s deadly wildfires this month, the organization’s figurehead wrote in an op-ed for Time magazine. Blaming the fire on climate change and the sundry social maladies that allegedly accompany it became a cottage industry in this historic disaster’s wake. Indeed, if climate change wasn’t directly responsible for the devastating blaze, Hawaii governor Josh Green agreed that the phenomenon at least “amplified” the causes of the blaze. Its proximate amplifiers notwithstanding, the cause of the fire increasingly looks like both human error and human malfeasance. It has been all but established at this point that the devastating fire that consumed Maui likely began as a result of a live power line snapping during a high-wind event, collapsing into some dry brush that the local utility provider had not cleared. But we may never fully establish the sequence of events that produced the fire, partly because the evidence has already been tampered with. Via the Washington Post: Hawaiian Electric — which acted quickly to restore power on the island after Aug. 8 — hauled away fallen poles, power lines, transformers, conductors and other equipment from near a Lahaina substation starting around Aug. 12, documents show, before investigators from the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) arrived on scene. Those actions may have violated national guidelines on how utilities should handle and preserve evidence after a wildfire and deprives investigators the opportunity to view any poles or downed lines in an undisturbed condition before or after the fire started, according to court documents, letters and other records obtained by The Washington Post. Not only is the utility accused by Maui County in a court filing of “inexcusably” failing to shut off power in response to the warnings it received of incoming high winds and failing to maintain the vegetation surrounding its equipment properly, it is now accused of misleading state and federal investigators. This is only the latest in a series of revelations about the incompetence of functionaries occupying sinecures in a one-party state dropping their respective balls with terrible consequences. But quite unlike global levels of heat-trapping emissions or the weather those gases influence, individual Hawaii residents can actually do something about the unacceptable incompetence of their public officials.",Conservative
National Review,"The original Children’s Crusade to establish a Christian kingdom in Jerusalem evidently didn’t end well. Count me very skeptical that nine hundred years later the new Children’s Crusade to defeat climate change through lawsuits is going to accomplish anything. In a 103-page order today in Held v. Montana, state district-court judge Kathy Seeley ruled that (1) sixteen Montana children had standing to challenge the constitutionality of Montana’s state energy system, and that (2) a state law that bars agencies from considering greenhouse gas emissions and climate impacts for any project violates the children’s right to a clean and healthful environment under the state constitution. States are free to depart from the standing principles that apply in federal courts, and I claim no particular knowledge of Montana standing law. That said, Judge Seeley undertakes to apply seemingly familiar doctrines of injury, causation, and redressability (see pp. 86-90), so I figured I’d briefly explain why her discussion of redressability—the ability of the court to grant relief that would remedy plaintiffs’ alleged injuries—strikes me as highly suspect. According to Seeley, Montana accounts for total carbon-dioxide emissions of 166 million tons per year. Global emissions were over 37 billion tons in 2021. So Montana accounts for less than ½ of one percent of global carbon-dioxide emissions. Further, it is anyone’s guess whether requiring Montana agencies to consider greenhouse gas emissions in issuing permits and approvals would result in any reduction in associated emissions. If Seeley herself has offered a guess, I missed it on my quick first read. So the likely effect of her order on Montana’s emissions might well be zero or infinitesimal. Yet further, by Seeley’s own account, what matters far more than ongoing annual emissions is cumulative emissions over recent decades. So that makes it even less likely that her order would have any effect on the children’s alleged health injuries. (If it would have any effect, In sum, Seeley’s order makes a very feeble case that she is able to redress plaintiffs’ alleged injuries, so it would seem that her ruling that they have standing to pursue their claims is unsound. (Insofar as Justice Stevens’s controversial opinion for a five-justice majority in Massachusetts v. EPA (2007) provides support for Seeley’s ruling on standing, the Montana supreme court would of course not have to apply that ruling to state standing rules.)",Conservative
National Review,"Europe’s climate-change policies are at risk of failure because its governments have ignored the costs they impose on voting blocs that urban elites don’t understand or have contempt for. The perceptive newsletter EuroIntelligence, edited by former Financial Times columnist Wolfgang Münchau, says, “One of the mistakes policy analysts keep on repeating with growing enthusiasm is to view the world” from an urban perspective that ignores the interests of farmers, rural homeowners, and commuters. Germany’s left-leaning government promotes cheaper public transit, green cities, and bicycle lanes for its voters while curbing pesticide use, fossil-fuel-powered cars, and gas stoves. Its popularity has plummeted in the polls. The Dutch government just fell after a new party of farmers and small-business owners opposed to onerous climate-change regulations placed first in local elections. Münchau says that since Brexit, the revolt of non-urban voters has become “the single most important issue to be tackled in the entire climate-change agenda, for otherwise we would expect every single one of (its) environmental targets, like the EU’s 2035 phase out of fuel-driven cars, and the 2050 net zero target, to succumb to political resistance.” As you see Europe slowly retreat from the preposterously ambitious green agenda in coming years, remember that much of it will stem from a middle-class revolt against that way of life.",Conservative
National Review,"From CNN’s Don Lemon comes a nice example of the total inability of so many in the media to discuss any topic outside of their preferred frames. The acting director of NOAA’s Hurricane Center, Jamie Rohme, wants to talk about Hurricane Ian. But Lemon isn’t interested in Hurricane Ian. He’s interested in climate change. So he talks about that instead: This is amazing. Don Lemon tries to blame Hurricane Ian on climate change. NOAA's hurricane director shuts him down. “We can come back and talk about climate change at a later time,” says the director, before giving an explanation of Ian’s intensification patterns and the formation of a second eyewall. “Pretty interesting for your viewers,” he suggests. But not, apparently, for Lemon, who insists that his guest had “said you want to talk about climate change” — which he hadn’t, as anyone with elementary social skills could have deduced — and immediately returns to where he started. “I don’t think you can link climate change to any one event,” says the director. “To link it to any one event, I would caution against that.” To which Lemon responds that he grew up “there” — by which he didn’t mean Florida, but Louisiana; declares that “these storms are intensifying”; and then, with palpable irritation, moves on.

National Review,"Flights that can be covered in under two-and-a-half hours by an equivalent train ride will no longer be allowed to operate in France. “This is an essential step and a strong symbol in the policy of reducing greenhouse gas emissions,” the country’s Transportation Minister, Clement Beaune, said in a statement following the announcement on Tuesday. “As we fight relentlessly to decarbonize our lifestyles, how can we justify the use of the plane between the big cities which benefit from regular, fast and efficient connections by train,” the official added. The ruling has only led to the cancellation of three flight routes so far, connecting Paris Orly Airport with the French cities of Bordeaux, Nantes, and Lyon. The ban leaves short-distance flights to Marseilles, which takes three hours by plane, unaffected. Laurent Donceel, the head of the industry group Airlines for Europe (A4E), told the French news agency, AFP, that such regulations “will only have minimal effects,” on CO2 emissions and demanded “real and significant solutions,” instead of such “symbolic bans.” Conversely, the professional body’s strategy to achieve net zero emissions by 2050 includes substituting jet fuel for more renewable sources and introducing electric and hydrogen-powered aircraft. The new regulation represents a diluted version of French president Emmanuel Macron’s earlier proposal in 2019, banning flights that could be completed by train rides of four hours. Pushback from the national carrier, Air France-KLM, ultimately led the government to walk back and reconsider its initial plan. However, domestic consumer groups, including UFC-Que Choisir, had originally demanded the government stand by its earlier rhetoric. “On average, the plane emits 77 times more CO2 per passenger than the train on these routes, even though the train is cheaper and the time lost is limited to 40 minutes,” the group told the BBC on Tuesday. Moreover, UFC-Que Choisir asked the government to implement “safeguards” to prevent national rail carriers from seizing “the opportunity to artificially inflate its prices or degrade the quality of rail service.” The law, which was first passed in 2021, required the European Commission, a regulatory body of the EU, to approve the measure before its full implementation.",Conservative
National Review,"The Supreme Court declined to hear appeals by major oil companies to move climate-change lawsuits against them from state to federal courts, with the latter being far more skeptical of such suits. Oil companies such as Chevron Corporation and Shell Corporation are facing a wave of public-nuisance lawsuits across the country alleging varied environmental harms from the emissions of greenhouse gases. Some of the plaintiffs include the State of Rhode Island, the City of Baltimore, and Boulder County, Colo. The state and local plaintiffs were backed by the Biden administration in seeking to keep the lawsuits in state courts, a reversal from the Trump administration’s position. The state-level litigation represents a major threat to the oil industry and has been likened to state litigation filed against tobacco companies in the 1990s and more recent cases against pharmaceutical companies accused of fueling the opioid epidemic. An example of such a case is Baltimore’s 2018 suit filed in Maryland state court, in which the city said it has suffered climate-change-related injuries from rising sea levels and extreme weather. The city is seeking to recover monetary damages from companies who have allegedly contributed to climate change and misled the public. Theodore Boutrous, who represents Chevron in several of the disputes, told the Wall Street Journal that the proper venue is the federal level. “Climate change is an issue of national and global magnitude that requires a coordinated federal policy response, not a disjointed patchwork of lawsuits in state courts across multiple states,” said Boutrous. “These wasteful lawsuits in state courts will do nothing to advance global climate solutions, nothing to reduce emissions, and nothing to address climate-related impacts.” The oil companies have also argued that these lawsuits are not the proper way to combat climate change. “Addressing a challenge as big as climate change requires a truly collaborative, society-wide approach. We do not believe the courtroom is the right venue to address climate change, but that smart policy from government, supported by action from all business sectors, including ours, and from civil society, is the appropriate way to reach solutions and drive progress,” read a statement Shell Corporation has sent out in response to several climate-change lawsuits. A number of groups focused on protecting consumers have said that public-nuisance lawsuits are being weaponized to accomplish liberal policy goals. “Over time, left-leaning officials at the state and local level have worked with trial lawyers and liberal advocacy groups to push the boundaries of public nuisance claims. State and local governments have turned to public-nuisance claims to address an ever-expanding range of issues, including climate change, opioids, vaping, and more. Their goal has been to use public-nuisance claims to implement public policy through the courts,” read a report from Alliance for Consumers. “Because trial lawyers often work off contingency fee arrangements, in which they receive a percentage of any financial award in the case, public-nuisance suits have become a substantial financial windfall for the law firms pressing these cases, beyond the benefit they get from pushing their preferred public policy positions through the courts,” the report continued, adding that the windfall is often poured into left-leaning political committees and campaigns, creating a feedback loop.

National Review,"It is fair to wonder whether anything John Kerry says actually influences Biden administration policy. Kerry may well be doing the job that President Biden wants him to do, which is to fly on his private jet to climate change summits and conferences around the world, and to talk about how much Biden and the administration care about climate change. Kerry can shrug off China’s use of slave labor, share a laugh and handshakes with Venezuelan dictator Nicolás Maduro, praise Vladimir Putin as “very forthcoming and thoughtful” about ways to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions,” and his deputies can attend events sponsored by the Chinese Communist Party. No matter how brutal, ruthless, or anti-American a dictator you are, if you murmur the right happy talk about climate change, Kerry will appear, shake your hand, smile during the photo op, and tell reporters how helpful, thoughtful, and sophisticated and nuanced you are. No word on whether any recent dictators have gotten to enjoy a full dinner with Kerry, as Syrian dictator Bashir Assad did in 2013. But someone in the administration really ought to ask themselves if Kerry is helping them achieve their objectives when he goes around the country making statements like this: “We have to work with China, we have to work with India,” Kerry said during an interview Friday at Yahoo News’ New York offices. “We even have to find a way, ultimately, if we can resolve the war in Ukraine, to work with Russia, because Russia is a huge emitter. And any one of these countries has an ability — if it doesn’t move to change its energy base — to make it much harder for the rest of the world, if not impossible, to reach the goals we’ve set.” “If we can resolve the war in Ukraine” – well, that’s a really big “if” there, senator. Kerry continued: “What is happening in Ukraine is an abomination,” he said. “It is a violation of everything we have worked to achieve since World War II, where we put in place rule of law, international law. … So this is an important fight, but it’s not an exclusive fight. We also have to deal with climate at the same time.” As discussed in today’s Morning Jolt, Putin has announced a move that would violate the international Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, and Russia has already broken the extension of the START Treaty. Why on earth would anyone think that a Russian regime that is breaking its treaties left and right is going to start honoring its treaties agreeing to reduce carbon emissions? As the late great historian Paul Johnson wrote, the only thing that guarantees the honoring of a treaty is the potential consequences for violating it, including the threat of military force. You could argue that one of the reasons the world faces the mess it is in is because it put too much faith in treaties and agreements that had too little enforcement. In the 1994 Budapest Memorandum, Ukraine gave up the remaining nuclear weapons it had from the Soviet Union in exchange for Russia promising it would respect Ukraine’s territorial integrity and inviolability of its borders, and to refrain from the use or threat of military force. Oh, well. Kerry has interpreted his mandate to work with any regime on earth on climate change, no matter how much that regime is opposing the U.S. in other matters. It is an absurd contradiction that hostile regimes enjoy exploiting, playing on the naivete and ego of a former secretary of state who probably can’t believe that his old blathering Senate colleague is now sitting in the Oval Office.",Conservative
National Review,"The U.S. ski team will wear race suits with a political message when they compete at the world championships this month, according to a new report. The American skiers will wear blue-and-white suits featuring images of ice chunks floating in the ocean — a design inspired by a satellite photo of icebergs breaking because of high temperatures, the Associated Press reported. The nonprofit organization Protect Our Winters (POW) helped design the uniforms, which the team will wear at the championships in Courchevel and Meribel, France, which kicked off Monday. “By coming together, we can educate and mobilize our snowsports community to push for the clean energy technologies and policies that will most swiftly reduce emissions and protect the places we live and the lifestyles we love,” POW executive director Mario Molina said in a statement. POW is a group of athletes, business leaders and scientists who aim to “give a national voice to the outdoor sports community, an industry that supports 7.6 million jobs and creates $887 billion in economic revenue,” according to the group’s website. “While the fossil fuel lobby may outspend environmentalists 20-1 in D.C., we share a passion that crosses party lines — a unique perspective that de-politicizes climate discussion — and an industry with an economic impact that can’t be ignored,” the organization adds. The group advocates in its 2024 strategic plan for federal and state climate policies to “reduce emissions, add renewable energy to the grid and create clean jobs for the workforce transition.” The plan concludes in saying, “2020 will go down in history as a turning point. Political turmoil, the resurgence of overt racism, and COVID-19 coalesced into a perfect storm that left us all shaken. But some of the best things to come are already apparent. Others are less flashy but will have a significant impact on our emissions trajectory and our lifestyles in the decades to come.” Sophie Goldschmidt, the president and CEO of U.S. Ski & Snowboard, told the AP that while a race suit “is not solving climate change, it is a move to continue the conversation and show that U.S Ski & Snowboard and its athletes are committed to being a part of the future.” American skier Travis Ganong told the outlet he is “worried about a future where there’s no more snow.” “And without snow, there’s no more skiing. So this is very near and dear to me,” he said, adding that he has grown concerned with the environmental changes he has seen at several of the World Cup circuit’s venues. A group of ski racers are sending a letter to the International Ski Federation (FIS) to urge the governing body to take a stronger position on sustainability and climate change, Ganong told the AP. “They should be at the forefront of trying to adapt to this new world, and try to make it better, too,” he said.",Conservative
National Review,"No, Climate Change Is Not Making the Jersey Shore Unlivable A pre-Independence Day dispatch published in Axios warned readers that the effects of climate change are being felt most acutely by a population that receives a disproportionate share of the press’s attention: wealthy vacationers. So many of the world’s “once ideal” destinations for summer travel are becoming unpleasant, if not uninhabitable, and those with the means are opting for cooler locales “like Amsterdam and Copenhagen.” Axios cites a New York Times report to justify its claims about European travel trends, but it doesn’t stop there. Travelers without the means of well-heeled globetrotters are also feeling climate change’s sting. “Coastal towns in New Jersey and Florida that are typically popular in the summer are also becoming unpleasant and unsafe as they’re hit with ‘sunny-day floods,’ which is flooding that occurs due to rising seas as opposed to storms,” reads Axios’s summary of the verdict rendered by Project Drawdown’s senior climate scientist Kate Marvel. Her “number one message” is that “nowhere is safe.” The piece offers little more in the way of evidence that vacationers are shunning the Jersey Shore, deferring instead to statistics about glacial erosion and the decimation of the world’s coral reefs. As a lifelong New Jersey resident, that economically destabilizing development seems like something that would come up in conversation. It hasn’t. But why isn’t this a subject of existential dread in a state that depends on that income stream? Perhaps because the great shunning of the shore isn’t happening. By the end of the summer season in 2022, it was clear that experts who predicted a “very robust” summer tourism season following the Covid pandemic were right. That year turned in the driest summer on the shore in a half-century, but visitors took the weather in stride and “shrugged off inflation” to return to New Jersey’s beaches in droves. Indeed, “Operators were left with what is becoming a persistent problem: too many customers without enough staff,” the Asbury Park Press reported. When the data was in, the summer 2022 season featured the largest volume of visitors since the onset of the pandemic — eclipsing even pre-pandemic numbers from 2018. But what about these “sunny-day floods” that have allegedly made life at the shore unlivable? So-called “nuisance” flooding has always been a feature of life in the low-lying towns along New Jersey’s coast, but an increase in the number of high-tide floods has been projected for years. A 2021 Associated Press report details the experience of residents in Bay Head, N.J. — a bayside town adjacent to the high-traffic tourist destination Point Pleasant Beach. The municipality had committed to a review of its “nuisance flooding” preparedness, events that occur between twelve and 18 times per year. Future-proofing this enclave will be a civil-engineering project but, according to the city’s environmental commission, not one that is technologically unfeasible or financially prohibitive. The deeper into media accounts of New Jersey’s diluvian horrors you go, the harder it is to avoid the conclusion that the press is terribly vexed by the state’s refusal to panic. “You could be forgiven for thinking the Jersey Shore’s local governments are not terribly concerned by such warnings,” read a scolding 2021 New York Times magazine feature. No state has constructed as many new homes in risk zones along the shore in the last decade — “not even Florida, with far more shoreline.” Older and quainter cottages are being replaced with luxury villas, and towns along the coast are committing to flood-mitigation projects and new building codes to meet new environmental challenges. It’s not the effort but the aesthetic that apparently rankles Times profiler Andrew Lewis. After all, some of the stilts onto which beachside hutches are affixed are rising to “cartoonish heights,” and whole blocks are being “cordoned off” as workers upgrade roads and plumbing infrastructure. Taken together, the impact of climate change on tourism-dependent Jersey Shore communities sounds like a manageable problem. If your activism depends on the public’s belief that “nowhere is safe,” that’s a problem. Perhaps in deference to the principle of “smart brevity,” Axios left all this context on the cutting-room floor. But by handing over the platform to the unverifiable claims of climate-change activists, Axios sacrificed half its mission statement and preserved only “brevity.”",Conservative
National Review,"Life after Climate Change The global discussion about climate change has become quite hysterical. Some 60 percent of people living in the rich world think it is likely to bring an end to humanity. This is not only untrue; it is also harmful, because fear makes people embrace bad policies and ignore many other urgent challenges facing the world. Consider, for example, how the World Health Organization declared climate change the defining public-health issue of the 21st century in 2014, but perhaps should have been more focused on pandemics, like Covid. Or take the World Economic Forum participants who in January 2020 found the greatest policy risk of the next ten years to be climate-action failure — ignoring the rapid spread of Covid. Or consider how development institutions increasingly focus on helping poor countries with climate-change responses, often at the expense of other things those countries urgently need, such as growth and development, stronger health-care systems, better education, and a more plentiful energy supply. Climate change is a real and man-made phenomenon, and it will have negative impacts overall. That’s a fact, and it is one that we hear a lot. The “catastrophe narrative,” however, is drowning out many other relevant facts about climate change — for example, that 98 percent fewer people are dying from climate-related disasters today than did a century ago, and that net-zero-emission policies are eye-wateringly costly. The following are eight charts that I think more people should see, to understand that the climate-change data are very different from what we hear in the commonplace narrative. 1. Hurricanes These days, every weather phenomenon is turned into instant climate news, with smartphone cameras immediately sharing pictures of the damage and campaigners blaming climate change for it all. Hurricanes are a key part of this narrative. But that does not mean hurricanes are actually battering our coasts any more frequently than before, as is often implied or stated outright. Indeed, the hurricanes of 2022 were close to unprecedented — but only in their weakness. Globally, 2022 had the second-weakest batch of hurricanes in the era of satellite data (beginning in 1980). It also had the fourth-fewest strong hurricanes (category 3 and above) in the same period and the eighth-fewest hurricanes overall. Moreover, despite what we hear, hurricanes have not been getting stronger globally. The average energy per hurricane has remained constant in the satellite era. The same is true if we focus on the United States. Contrary to what is commonly asserted, the frequency of hurricanes hitting the continental U.S. has not increased over the past 122 years. The best-fit line actually trends slightly downward. (Counting landfall hurricanes is the most consistent way of having a measure that goes back to 1900, whereas the number of named hurricanes — which includes those that do not hit land — steadily increases because we have ever-better technologies to detect even very short-lived hurricanes.) The U.N. Climate Panel expects that climate change will increase the global proportion of strong hurricanes by 10 to 20 percent, while the total number of hurricanes will remain constant or fall. This will make damages worse overall than if there were no climate change — a legitimate example of global warming having a net harmful impact. But it is important to keep a sense of proportion. Today, hurricanes around the world cause damage each year worth 0.04 percent of global GDP. And because the world will be much richer in the future, there will be more property to damage. But richer societies are also more resilient and better able to protect lives and assets. Taking all these factors into account, without climate change, annual hurricane damage would decline to 0.01 percent of global GDP by 2100, as estimated in a highly cited Nature study. But because climate change will increase the proportion of the worst hurricanes, damages with climate change will instead cost 0.02 percent of GDP. In other words, the world will get better (with lower damages than at present from hurricanes as a share of GDP), but climate change will slow down this progress. 2. Heat and Cold One of the most publicized effects of climate change is deaths caused by rising temperatures, especially during heat waves. Every summer we see the media in Europe and North America seize upon spikes in temperature to warn about the urgent need to tackle climate change. What we rarely hear is that cold also kills — and it kills many more. A July 2021 study in the Lancet, Britain’s premier medical journal, showed that heat currently causes just over 1 percent of all global deaths, or almost 600,000 each year. Cold kills eight times as many — about 4.5 million people annually. Cold deaths are more frequent not just in cold areas but, surprisingly, across the world. (Even the climate-alarmed Washington Post grudgingly accepts this.) Cold kills mainly because it makes blood vessels constrict to direct more heat to the body’s core organs, driving up blood pressure and increasing risks for strokes and heart attacks. As temperatures rise, cold will kill fewer people. The Lancet estimates that the observed temperature rise over the past two decades has increased heat deaths by 0.21 percent but decreased cold deaths by 0.51 percent. With the current population, that change means that global warming actually prevents 166,000 temperature-related deaths every year. Had we stopped global warming two decades ago, more people today would be dying from the temperature. Deaths from both heat and cold need our attention. For heat, adaptation is fairly simple with better information, plenty of fluids, and access to cool areas during the peak days. This is why heat deaths in rich countries — despite climate change — have generally declined in recent decades: Air-conditioning is a relatively affordable option. Cold is much harder to tackle, since adaptation requires heating homes for months, which is often prohibitively expensive for poorer households. One study shows that when fracking drove down U.S. natural-gas prices around 2010, it allowed poorer households especially to be better heated, saving an estimated 11,000 lives each year. In summary, to address both heat and cold, we need access to plentiful and cheap energy — the opposite of what many climate policies would achieve. 3. Polar Bears Climate activists have long used polar bears as an iconic image of looming apocalypse, as when Al Gore’s influential film An Inconvenient Truth showed a sad animated polar bear floating away to its death, or when the Washington Post in 2004, citing alarmist statements from the World Wildlife Fund, claimed that polar bears could face extinction. The best data on polar-bear populations come from the official assessments of polar-bear-specialist scientists. They estimate the global population today is somewhere between 22,000 and 31,000, clearly higher than the 12,000 they estimated in the 1960s. Even the newest data, referenced in the latest report from polar-bear-specialist researchers, show that polar-bear numbers are increasing, not decreasing. These facts used to be uncontroversial. In 2008, a CNN science journalist who interviewed numerous polar-bear scientists found that all “agree[d] that polar-bear populations have, in all likelihood, increased in the past several decades.” In recent years, however, major media outlets, including AFP, have started “fact-checking” those (like me) who point out that the number of polar bears is rising. What changed? The media’s new willingness to disregard facts in favor of a simplistic narrative about climate change, now disingenuously suggesting that we’ve never really known what the right number of polar bears was, and therefore we can’t say if there are more, whereas previously they acknowledged that of course polar-bear numbers had risen. We should remember that polar bears survived the last interglacial period, 130,000 to 115,000 years ago, when it was significantly warmer than it is now. But the bigger point is this: Numbers are up because the polar bear used to be heavily hunted. Beginning in 1976, a partial hunting ban protected the bears better, and the populations recovered. Indeed, hunting has always been the main threat to the polar bear, and protection is pivotal. If we care about polar bears, it is hunting that we should focus on. 4. Fire We can add wildfires to the list of natural disasters that are overhyped in climate coverage. Back in the early 1900s, about 4.2 percent of land worldwide burned every year. A century later, that figure had dropped to almost 3 percent. The decline has continued through the modern era, with satellites measuring burn across the globe every day. These data are entirely uncontroversial. Even a report from the World Wildlife Fund — chillingly subtitled “A Crisis Raging out of Control?” — concedes that “the area of land burned globally has actually been steadily declining since it started to be recorded in 1900.” Human ingenuity gets the credit for the decrease: People have moved fire from hearths to power stations, converted untamed land into protected farms, and become well-off enough to afford fire suppression and forest management. Climate studies that predict significantly more fires typically ignore this history. They model only temperature changes, excluding what people might do in response. Conditions conducive to wildfires will indeed become more common as temperatures continue to rise. But that doesn’t mean people will idly let it happen — and when models factor in predicted human adaptation, such as controlled burning, these increases in fire damage disappear. To be sure, more people will probably be threatened by fires in the future, and more are threatened now than in the past. But this is not a result of climate change. It is because part of the world’s growing population chooses to settle where wildfires are more common. The number of homes in high-fire-risk zones in the western U.S. has increased thirteenfold over the past 80 years and is set to increase further by 2050. A 2016 Nature study finds this trend to be global: “Contrary to common perception, human exposure to wildfires increases in the future mainly owing to projected population growth in areas with frequent wildfires, rather than by a general increase in burned area.” Decreasing future wildfire victims has very little to do with climate-change policies and almost everything to do with simpler, cheaper measures, such as improving forest management, enforcing stricter zoning, making neighborhoods more resilient, and strengthening building codes so that fewer people are in harm’s way. 5. Not What Matters for Malnutrition The World Health Organization has warned that climate change will cause an additional 250,000 deaths each year in the two decades following 2030, with 95,000 of them due to malnutrition. This sounds alarming, but it misleads. The WHO’s numbers come from comparing the actual world with an imaginary one in which there is no climate change, and calculating the difference between them in the number of deaths from malnutrition, malaria, diarrhea, dengue fever, flooding, and heat (they ignore cold deaths). In fact, malnutrition deaths are forecast to decline rapidly over the next three decades, in part because of increasing crop yields. Admittedly, climate change makes these yields increase slightly more slowly; according to the WHO, the difference in 2030 will be 95,000 additional deaths. But there are more factors involved, going beyond crop yields. The big picture, revealed in the graph, shows a much improving world, with climate change causing the world to get better, if slightly more slowly than it would without climate change. Economic development is the main reason malnutrition will decline dramatically: More families will be able to buy food. The WHO has low-, medium-, and high-growth scenarios. Low economic growth eventuates in 2 million malnutrition deaths by 2050, whereas high growth will see 300,000 deaths. Given this perspective, the importance of global warming decreases significantly. Even very stringent climate policies would save only a small part of the 95,000 additional people the WHO projects will succumb to malnutrition. But policies ensuring high rather than low growth can avoid 1.7 million deaths each year, whereas climate policies rein in growth and cause more people to be poorer. What most helps the world’s poor is getting them out of poverty. Well-intentioned but expensive climate policies can end up making them much worse off. 6. Fewer Deaths from Climate President Biden’s former national climate adviser Gina McCarthy has declared that “climate change is the most significant public-health issue of our time.” She said it in January 2021, the same month when the country had a record death toll from Covid. But even if we ignore the pandemic, she was not even close to being right. If we were to assume that every single heat-related death in the U.S. was caused by climate change (that’s 8,600 deaths a year), along with every single death caused by extreme weather (another 409 people), the toll doesn’t top 10,000. It pales in comparison with the 181,000 people who are killed by cold temperatures, or the 746,000 people who die from cancers. The most significant public-health issue in the U.S. today is cardiovascular disease, which kills 923,000 people a year. Not only is climate not the big killer of our times, it also isn’t claiming more lives than before — as this graph shows. Globally, a century ago, almost half a million people died each year from storms, floods, droughts, wildfires, and extreme temperatures — what we might think of as weather-related deaths. In the past ten decades, such deaths have dropped by 98 percent, even while the global population has increased massively. In 2022, fewer than 11,000 people died across the entire world from all these climate-related events. We went from half a million deaths to 11,000. Why? Because we have more resources and better technology, and hence people are more resilient. We are safer than ever. 7. Renewables since 1800: Not Going Net-Zero We constantly hear that renewable energies are taking over from fossil fuels, as though all the hard work had been done already and the only thing still needed to stop climate change was a little more political willpower. This is wishful thinking. The fact is, solar and wind are still capable of meeting only a fraction of global electricity needs. Even with huge subsidies and political support, solar and wind delivered just 10 percent of global electricity in 2021. Heating, transport, and vital industrial processes account for much more energy use than does electricity generation. This means solar and wind deliver just 1.9 percent of the global energy supply. And electricity is the easiest of these components to decarbonize: We haven’t yet made meaningful progress toward greening the remaining four-fifths of global energy. The most renewable continent is Africa. Half of its energy comes from renewables, almost exclusively wood, dung, and cardboard burned for cooking and heating — which kills about 700,000 people a year in sub-Saharan Africa with indoor air pollution. A billion Africans have little reliable energy because they’re poor. California uses more energy in its pools and hot tubs than all 60 million inhabitants of Tanzania use together. Economic development can move them out of this unenviable position, but it will also mean that Africans use much more fossil fuel. In its newest report, the International Energy Agency estimates that even implementing all current political promises will make the world only about 30 percent renewable by 2050. An extrapolation suggests that the world will reach 100 percent renewable only by late next century. It is much more difficult to get rid of fossil fuels than most campaigners will admit. To fulfill the promises made in the Paris climate accords, the United Nations says, annual reduction by 2030 would have to be eleven times what we managed to achieve when the world ground to a halt during the Covid lockdowns. That is hardly realistic. 8. Cost of Going Net-Zero Then there’s the question of how all this can be paid for. Consultancy firm McKinsey has made probably the most comprehensive global overview of the cost of going net-zero. It would be fantastically expensive. Just the additional cost of low-emission assets and infrastructure would be $5.6 trillion annually. That is more than one-third of the global annual tax intake. If costs of more than a trillion dollars for the U.S., or the same amount for the EU, are not astounding enough, look at emerging-economy India, now the most populous country in the world, which is striving to swiftly eradicate poverty. Going net-zero would cost India a massive 9 percent of GDP each and every year. That is about three-fourths of the total Indian tax intake. Imagining that India would spend most of its available resources to achieve net-zero is just a fantasy. The same is true for sub-Saharan Africa and other developing and emerging economies. But it’s not as if things are much more achievable in rich countries. One American  study found that reducing emissions by 80 percent could cost each American more than $5,000 every year by 2050. The same analysis found that going almost net-zero (say, reducing emissions 95 percent) could double that cost. It seems unlikely that any politicians will get reelected on that ticket, so these policies are doomed to failure. In Summary Global warming is real, but it is not the end of the world. Indeed, the world’s only climate economist to win the Nobel Prize in economics estimates that if we do nothing, the cost of climate change will be equivalent to a loss of about 4 percent of GDP by the end of the century. This is certainly not nothing. But remember that by the end of the century, the U.N. itself, in its middle-of-the-road scenario, estimates that the average person in the world will be about 450 percent as rich as the average person is today. As I have shown in my peer-reviewed 2020 article in the journal Technological Forecasting and Social Change, the 4 percent reduction means that by the end of the century, instead of being 450 percent as rich, the average person will be “only” 434 percent as rich because of the effects of climate change. This is less good than it could have been — and it is one of the reasons we should tackle the climate problem. But it is certainly not the end of the world. And if the panic means we end up adopting poor climate policies and spending 5 to 10 percent of our GDP on them, we could very well end up worse off overall. Economic research overwhelmingly shows that the best way to address climate change is not by asking everyone to be colder and poorer. This hardly works in the rich world, and certainly not in the world’s poorer places. Instead, we need to do what America does best: invest in innovation. Humanity has long relied on innovation to solve big problems. We didn’t solve air pollution by forcing everyone to stop driving but by inventing the catalytic converter, which drastically lowers pollution. We didn’t slash hunger by telling everyone to eat less but through innovations of the third agricultural revolution, which enabled farmers to produce much more food. Yet innovation in green energy has been neglected as campaigners and “green” corporations have rushed to roll out inefficient technology — and get it subsidized by taxpayers. In 1980 the rich world spent more than eight cents of every $100 of its GDP on R&D in low-carbon technologies. But as climate policies focused on making fossil fuels more expensive, green-research spending was halved to less than four cents of every $100. Researchers for the Copenhagen Consensus, including three Nobel-laureate economists, have shown that the most effective climate policy possible is to increase green-R&D spending fivefold, to $100 billion per year. We need to look for breakthroughs across all areas of energy technology, from cheaper solar and wind, coupled with massive and very cheap energy storage, to CO₂ extraction, fusion, second-generation biofuels, next-generation nuclear energy, and many other potential solutions. This will not just help rich, well-meaning Americans and Europeans to cut emissions a bit, but will get China, India, and Africa on board as well. Climate change will be solved not by making fossil energy unaffordable, but by innovating the price of green technologies downward so that everyone can afford the switch.",Conservative
National Review,"Don’t Believe Biden’s Tack toward the Center on Climate Change By making it easier for cities and states to sue oil companies, the administration continues to push its radical environmental agenda. The Supreme Court should reject it. The Biden administration is gesturing toward the center by choosing oil-drilling over climate-change craziness. Last Monday, President Biden approved the $8 billion Alaska Willow project, which will drill for 600 million barrels of oil from “pristine federal land,” in the words of the New York Times. Environmentalists cried betrayal from a president who campaigned on ending all drilling on federal land, while political pundits praised the move as an example of Biden’s centrist policies. But when voters peer behind the symbolism, they will see that the White House continues to pursue its radical environmental agenda by the everyday decisions of the administrative state. Just this week, the Biden Justice Department went to the Supreme Court to urge it to allow cities and states to inflict outrageous lawsuits against oil companies for allegedly causing global warming. It is not often that the Supreme Court can do anything about climate change. For the most part, the Constitution limits the courts to deciding cases or controversies that involve federal law or that contain a significant federal interest. However, in several cases pending review — against most of the major energy companies in the nation — the Supreme Court could short-circuit this local effort to distort out national energy markets and bring these cases to an immediate halt. By ignoring the Biden Justice Department, the justices could move the nation toward a far more sensible and responsible approach to global warming. Led by New York and San Francisco (of course), progressive cities and counties have invented lawsuits against every energy company imaginable, from oil companies Chevron and Exxon to refiners and gas sellers for their role in causing climate change. Joined by cities such as Boulder, Baltimore, Oakland, San Francisco, San Mateo, Honolulu, and the State of Rhode Island, these leading liberal lights suddenly discovered around 2017 that global warming constitutes a “public nuisance” that harms their residents and justifies financial penalties. These cities claim that the energy companies have caused broad injury through the “production and promotion of massive quantities of fossil fuels,” thus triggering a “global warming-induced sea level rise” followed by flooding, erosion, and harm to municipal infrastructure and water systems. The cities demand that the energy companies fund a “climate change adaptation program” to build sea walls, raise the elevation of buildings, and construct “such other infrastructure as is necessary.” (Ka-ching!) Never mind immediate disasters such as rising crime, stubborn homelessness, and failing schools; San Francisco, New York, and their sister cities will make sure homes stay high and dry 80 years from now. Energy companies have lost most of their challenges to these lawsuits in court, where states have successfully claimed that there is no federal law that can stop them. The cities and states argue that they are only bringing lawsuits under state law, and that there is no federal interest at stake. Even if fossil-fuel companies have federal law and interests on their side, cities and states demand that the companies wait until the cases have wended their way through the state courts, likely a trip of five to ten years, before they can get a hearing at the U.S. Supreme Court. By the time a case such as this reaches the Supreme Court justices, elected state judges might have imposed billions in judgments against the companies and raised costs on energy production nationwide. In its filing this week, the Biden Justice Department blessed this climate-activist strategy. Put aside whether forcing energy companies, which require licenses from the federal government to extract and sell oil and gas, to pay damages could have any real impact on global warming. These lawsuits plainly misuse states’ traditional control over laws governing accidents (known as torts) to control conduct beyond their borders. States have the right to regulate the environment and economic activity within their borders; they can impose liability for pollution and similar harms by factories, for example. But the problem is that global warming does not, for the most part, take effect primarily within any single state. As even John Kerry, the Biden administration’s climate-change special envoy, has conceded, “almost 90 percent of the planet’s global emissions come from outside of U.S. borders. We could go to zero tomorrow and the problem isn’t solved.” Greenhouse gases, as the Supreme Court itself observed in American Electric Power Co. v. Connecticut, do not remain local but quickly disperse and commingle in the atmosphere. “Emissions in [New York or] New Jersey may contribute no more to flooding in New York than emissions in China,” it said. China alone accounts for about one-third of all emissions. Blaming fossil fuels for climate change, which might then affect city budgets, amounts to the type of extraterritorial regulation forbidden by the Constitution. Under the “dormant” commerce clause, the Supreme Court has long struck down state laws that advance economic protectionism or environmental goals under the guise of health and safety. States cannot impose regulations on imports that effectively seek to control activity that primarily takes place beyond their borders. During the Great Depression, for example, the Court struck down New York’s effort to set a minimum price for a commodity, such as milk, because the state was attempting to “project its legislation” into neighboring states and hence defeat their competitive advantages. “The Constitution was framed under the dominion of a political philosophy less parochial in range,” the Court observed in Baldwin v. GAF Seelig. “It was framed upon the theory that the peoples of the several states must sink or swim together, and that in the long run prosperity and salvation are in union and not division.” Otherwise, the Court predicted, states would erect retaliatory barriers against each other’s trade. In response to these climate-change suits, for example, Texas, West Virginia, and other oil-producing states might impose costly regulations on electric cars or internet and financial services that originate in California and New York. It was to prevent self-defeating retaliation between the states that the Constitution vested Congress with authority over our single national market. States have a legitimate interest in protecting public health and safety from harmful conduct occurring within their borders. The conservative justices of the Rehnquist and Roberts Courts have sparked a mini-revival of federalist principles by limiting direct federal regulation to commercial matters. Judicial conservatives have further emphasized the need to maintain states’ sovereignty over issues such as education or crime and have even placed new limits on federal spending mandates. Americans who do not like California’s environmental policies or who cannot afford the high cost of living brought on by anti-growth regulations can always move to Texas or Florida — as they have recently done in the tens of thousands. Even with the recent revival of federalist principles, states do not have the right to control conduct beyond their territory. A state cannot seek to impose its own views of economic or environmental policy on the rest of the nation. Limiting energy use or replacing fossil fuels with renewable sources should be up to our elected representatives in the executive and legislative branches. It is to Congress, not California, Texas, or Florida, that the Constitution gives the power “to regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States.” Of course, every state policy might affect — to some small degree — the flow of interstate commerce, which is why, for example, the Court allows Congress to prohibit the sale of even the smallest amount of homegrown marijuana, as millions of transactions collectively make up the national market. The modern Supreme Court should strike down state laws if their burden on interstate commerce outweighs their claimed local benefits. Under this conventional judicial analysis, these local lawsuits should fail. The potential local benefit of these claims against energy companies is difficult to measure. Indeed, as Richard Epstein and others have pointed out, some of these same cities have assured investors buying their municipal bonds that they are “unable to predict” whether “seismic events, fires or other natural events, such as sea rise or other impacts of climate change . . . could occur, when they may occur, and, if any such events occur, whether they will have a material adverse effect.” The lawsuits are based on a faulty theory of public nuisance that holds only about a half-dozen energy companies responsible for the global rise in temperatures over many decades, without assigning them a precise share of the responsibility and comparing that with other, major sources of carbon dioxide, such as China and India, or other forms of activity, such as manufacturing or agriculture. Given the arguably very low contribution of these companies to overall climate change, cities and counties cannot show that any damages imposed on these companies will have any effect on, for example, the rise in sea levels and its consequences. Against these imaginary local benefits, courts will have to weigh the benefits to the national market of these energy companies’ continued work. Despite the push for renewable sources, fossil fuels still provide about 80 percent of all U.S. energy. Forcing energy companies to pay for global harms would place an exceptionally heavy burden on national markets and on interstate commerce that the federal courts should refuse to permit. Perhaps Americans believe that the nation should severely reduce its reliance on fossil fuels, even at the cost of price increases and supply insecurity. Perhaps they might even agree that billions of dollars should go to cities and states to mitigate the consequences of a rise in the sea level. But that decision should rest in the hands of our elected representatives in Congress, who journey to Washington, D.C., precisely to solve national problems. Supreme Court intervention unfortunately has become necessary because of progressives’ misuse of the judiciary to impose policies denied them by the normal electoral process. While conservatives generally favor state and local government, global warming by definition demands a uniform federal standard. If climate change truly is global, then it is Congress, not cities and states, that should solve it. Cities and counties have raised outlandish legal theories that would interfere with the enactment of a national climate-change policy. The Supreme Court should reject the Biden administration’s pleas and preserve the national government’s authority to solve a truly national problem.",Conservative
National Review,"The U.N.’s ‘Final Warning’ about Climate Change Won’t Be the Last Its new report is just the latest in a long line of doomsaying missives on the subject. Their predictions have a funny habit of failing to come true. The U.N.’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) released an assessment report eight years in the making on Monday, and one climate scientist billed it as the “final warning” that catastrophic climate change is imminent. U.N. Secretary General António Guterres was no less apocalyptic. Deeming the IPCC’s report a “clarion call” and a “survival guide for humanity,” Guterres asked “every country and every sector” to “fast-track climate efforts” on “every timeframe.” (By “every timeframe,” we can assume he didn’t mean the slow ones.) “If we act now,” Guterres allowed, “we can still secure a livable, sustainable future for all.” But it doesn’t require an especially close reading of the IPCC’s findings to conclude that its authors believe saving “humanity” is now a remote prospect. According to the AR6 Synthesis Report, which contains no new data but collects previous findings in one place, average global temperatures have already risen by 1.1 degrees Celsius (two degrees Fahrenheit) since the Industrial Revolution. The odds that humanity can stave off an increase of another .4 degrees Celsius or more, and thus avoid crossing a threshold that climate scientists believe to be significant, are almost nil. “If governments just stay on their current policies, the remaining carbon budget will be used up before the next IPCC report,” said Greenpeace International policy adviser Kaisa Kosonen. For the roughly 3.5 billion human beings who reside in areas the IPCC deems “highly vulnerable” to climate-change-related disasters, that’s bad news. They will face “acute food insecurity and reduced water security.” Already, “human mortality from floods, droughts, and storms” is on the rise, and that trend will accelerate. Mass-mortality events and species loss will continue, threatening interdependent ecosystems. Eventually, the Arctic permafrost will melt, releasing trapped greenhouse gases into the atmosphere and contributing to a runaway cycle of ecological devastation. The eschaton will be particularly bad for the “economically and socially marginalized,” with profound ramifications for “gender and social equity.” So, what are policy-makers supposed to do to avert all this impending doom? The first step would be to mothball coal-fired power plants and cancel plans for any new ones. But China is building the equivalent of two new coal-fired plants per week and shows no signs of slowing down, so that’s not going to happen. The world can and should commit to reforestation and the cultivation of carbon-absorbing vegetation like peat moss. Yet, as the Guardian admits, “no amount of tree planting will be enough to cancel out the effects of continued fossil fuel emissions.” We’re starting to run out of options. What about promising new ways of removing carbon from the atmosphere — so-called “carbon capture and storage (CCS)” technologies? The IPCC holds out hope for them while noting that they’re still in the developmental stages and remain cost-prohibitive. That’s a diplomatic description of what looks less like a panacea and more like a boondoggle every day. Under Joe Biden, the U.S. Department of Energy launched a five-year, $3.5 billion program to build four regional Direct Air Capture hubs designed to harness and store CO2 underground. An Iceland-based hub that serves as proof of concept captures around 4,000 tons of CO2 per year, but that barely registers compared with the estimated 36.8 billion tons of energy-related global emissions produced each year. And it gets bleaker still. Some firms are investing in carbon-capture technologies to purchase “carbon offsets,” a scheme that commodifies emissions reductions to justify the claim that its existing emissions are effectively “net zero.” According to one recent study, however, the carbon-offset-market registries are “systematically over-crediting projects and delivering dubious carbon offsets.” Indeed, offsets have allowed some environmentally disruptive industries — logging, for example — to engage in unsustainable practices while taking credit for reducing emissions. So, maybe there is no salvation for mankind, but there’s still time for the world to engineer what Guterres calls a “just transition” toward the hellscape of the future. If that phrase made you reach for your wallet, it should have. The U.N. identifies as one feature of a “just transition” a global commitment to tripling investments in renewable-energy sources so that they reach “at least $4 trillion dollars a year.” Of course, that’s nothing compared to the $551 trillion in economic damages one report associated with a potential 3.7-degree Celsius rise in average temperatures. For reference, Axios observes that “$551 trillion is more than all the wealth currently existing in the world.” In that sense, $4 trillion is a bargain, really. Moreover, the transition will involve a massive transfer of wealth from the developed to the developing world. “Wealthy governments have failed to provide $100 billion of climate finance a year they promised to developing countries by 2020, with the U.S. responsible for the vast majority of the shortfall,” read one IPCC-inspired indictment of the industrialized world. “It is a huge injustice,” declared Aditi Mukherji, one of the IPCC report’s 93 authors. “Climate justice is crucial because those who have contributed least to climate change are being disproportionately affected.” In sum, the Earth is all but certain to cross the threshold past which global warming becomes unsustainable. There are no effective technological remedies for this condition, and there’s even less resolve to pursue such remedies. Nevertheless, the world’s wealthiest countries should continue to deindustrialize and give away huge sums of money to the governments of developing states, which have even less regard for sustainable resource management and instead devote their energies to — you guessed it — economic development. The good news in the IPCC’s assessment is that it is likely subject to change, just as prior catastrophic predictions were. If climate scientists’ predictions were always accurate, the Arctic would be “nearly ice-free” today. The IPCC’s 2001 assessment anticipated a decline in the global severity of snowstorms, which did not materialize. The 2007 IPCC AR4 report predicted that rainfall shortages around the world would reduce agricultural yields by up to 50 percent. That didn’t happen, either. It also forecasted the disappearance of Himalayan glaciers — an assessment that was later retracted when it was revealed that the source on which it was based had not undergone peer review. This is the context climate-change alarmists want you to compartmentalize when they say “we should be hysterical,” as New York Times reporter Helene Cooper recommended in 2018 after the IPCC warned that mankind had just twelve years to stave off “devastating” global warming. But that prediction was itself a product of revised estimates about how much warming was already locked in. So we can rest assured of at least one thing: There will be many more “final warnings” in our future.",Conservative
National Review,"The Democrats’ Unserious Climate-Change Deal Shoveling hundreds of billions of dollars to the party’s allies isn’t sound economic or environmental policy. The corporate-welfare “climate-change bill” that Joe Manchin and his Democratic colleagues in Congress wish to inflict upon the republic is a bad piece of legislation for any number of reasons. The obvious one is the economic reason — the combination of higher taxes and a rush of hundreds of billions of dollars in new federal spending lands on the wrong side of both parts of our don’t-call-it-a-recession stagflation, in which we are seeing declining economic output, declining real wages, and inflation above 9 percent overall — and above 40 percent in energy prices. More uncertainty is the last thing American businesses need. Our progressive friends will tell us that a few hundred billion dollars is a reasonable price for a credible climate-change bill — but is it that? There are reasons to be skeptical. The Biden administration says it would like to see the United States reduce its emissions of carbon dioxide by 50 percent or more by 2030. Advocates of the Manchin folly say that its provisions could enable a reduction of 40 percent by 2030. Well, maybe. Keep in mind that when they say, “40 percent reduction in emissions,” they mean a 40 percent reduction from 2005 levels. Thanks in large part to the economic displacement of coal by natural gas in electricity generating — which is to say, thanks to fracking — the United States already has cut emissions by about 20 percent from where they were in 2005: We’re halfway there, having done not very much, and the trend line already is pointed downward — sharply downward during the economic pause associated with Covid-19, but gently downward even without that dramatic episode. The Manchin bill is, à la mode, a cowardly piece of legislation, in that it is all carrot, no stick. Its environmental program is mainly one of subsidies for politically connected business interests engaged in the so-called green-energy trade and handouts to upper-middle-class urban progressives who enjoy getting a $7,500 tax benefit when they buy a new Mercedes. What these subsidies amount to is a reverse carbon tax. The idea of a carbon tax is to make the costs of petroleum and coal high relative to renewables, in order to encourage the flourishing of those alternative sources; a subsidy does the same thing on the other end of the equation: The government is, in theory, spending money rather than collecting it, but the point is still to make wind, solar, and — with any luck — nuclear competitive with hydrocarbons by taking money out of someone’s pocket. Everybody loves the carrot. But the proposition that we are going to get the outcomes the Green New Dealers want simply by shoveling great heaping gobs of money to Democrats’ political allies without any painful new regulation or taxes is one that deserves a great deal of skepticism. The most obvious point of comparison is the European Union, which imposes an indirect carbon tax by means of a carbon-permit market; the benchmark contract currently trades around 76 euros per ton, but it has been as high as 100 euros per ton, a price level it is expected to achieve again or even exceed between now and 2024 as the (imbecilic and unnecessary) return to coal-fired power in Germany and elsewhere increases demand for emissions credits. As it stands, the price per ton of carbon emissions in the European Union is today about eleven times what it was a decade ago — as Milton Friedman never said, Ce n’était pas un repas gratuit. The price of European carbon contracts is mainly of interest to our friends over at Capital Matters, but for our purposes here, one fact is of keen interest: In spite of its imposition of a significant carbon price and in spite of its much more activist approach to the climate issue, the European Union has not decarbonized its economy — not even close, not even halfway, not even one quarter of the way. In 2020, renewables accounted for about 22 percent of the energy consumed in the European Union and about 10 percent of the energy used in EU transportation. Unsurprisingly, the European Union is farther along that curve than is the United States, which relies on renewables for about 13 percent of all its power compared with the European Union’s 22 percent, and which generates about 20 percent of its electricity by means of renewables, compared with the European Union’s 38 percent. That has real consequences for climate policy: By the most economically relevant measure (emissions per unit of GDP) the United States is about twice as carbon-intensive as Germany. But it is Germany, not the United States, that is getting ready to fire up coal plants. Policy proposals are constrained only by the utopian imagination; policy outcomes are constrained by physics, geography, and technology, among other inconvenient exogenous factors. At a sufficient level of subsidy, wind and solar are economically viable alternatives to coal and gas, but they are intermittent, and it is likely that their role in total electricity generation will always be a limited one. Affordable, nearby hydrocarbons — Russian gas or, in its absence, coal — are what is going to fill in the gaps. (The French, doing themselves a favor for once, generate most of their electricity with climate-friendly nuclear power, which provides a nice baseline load to support fluctuating renewable output.) Completely decarbonizing electricity is a long ways off, in reality something that probably isn’t going to happen and probably doesn’t need to happen — but consider that electricity is the low-hanging fruit: It is not want of forward-looking policy but physical and technological realities that fortify the central role of hydrocarbons in transportation. Even if we were willing to endure what surely would be an astronomical transition cost, there isn’t an electric long-haul truck on the market that can do what a diesel-powered semi does — at any price. Container ships are the lifeblood of the global trade in physical goods, and most of those run on barely refined oil. Even if we were willing to deal with the security issues involved in developing a nuclear-powered global cargo fleet (there have been prototypes), those ships do not yet exist, and neither does the fuel-processing infrastructure that would be necessary to sustain them. The case for a carbon tax is that current U.S. practice does not put any price on the externalities associated with burning hydrocarbons. And that is fair enough. But we should not delude ourselves into thinking that there exists some “clean” source of energy capable of sustaining modern life. As Thomas Sowell put it, “There are no solutions; there are only tradeoffs.” Some of those tradeoffs are economic: You can pay to make renewables relatively affordable either by subsidizing them or by taxing hydrocarbons. Others are environmental: The more batteries are used in transportation and utilities, the more battery manufacturing and disposal are going to be major environmental problems. Petrochemicals and petroleum-derived polymers are used in manufacturing solar cells, wind turbines, batteries, and much else that is “green.” When it comes to rare-earth minerals, many of the relevant geopolitical facts are geological facts. Beyond that, it is likely that demand for petrochemicals will in the near future outpace demand for fuels as the primary driver of worldwide oil consumption. Maybe at some point in the future the most common solar panels will be built of something other than petroleum-derived polymers, but in the here and now, that is not the case. There is no escape from the environmental effects of modern life, only management and mitigation. Those being the facts, the case for shunting a few hundred billion dollars into corporate welfare for Democratic political supporters is far from self-evident. It is particularly amusing to watch Democrats argue for a bill that purports to address the problem of businesses not paying their “fair share” in taxes while larding up that same bill with billions of dollars in special-interest tax credits for their favorite businesses. That is the great Democratic tax strategy: create tax subsidies for businesses and then, two elections later, complain that businesses take advantage of tax subsidies. It is the unserious program of an unserious party run by unserious people who increasingly resemble the ignoramuses and maniacs who elect them. If Democrats were trying to come up with a way of showing that they don’t think of the climate-change issue as anything more than an opportunistic pretext to raid the fisc on behalf of friends and cronies, they could hardly improve on this bill. I hope Senator Manchin got something really good in exchange, and that his new position is not too hard on his knees.",Conservative
